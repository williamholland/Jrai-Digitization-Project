All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David [were] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations. @ Tui anŭn čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng Abraham truh pơ Đawit hmâo pluh pă rơnŭk mơnuih; čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng Đawit truh pơ rơnŭk arăng ba ƀing ană Israel jing mơnă pơ čar Babilôn hmâo pluh pă rơnŭk mơnuih; laih anŭn čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng rơnŭk arăng ba ƀing Israel jing mơnă pơ čar Babilôn truh pơ rơnŭk Yang Krist ăt hmâo pluh pă rơnŭk mơnuih mơ̆n.
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, that is, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of [the] Holy Spirit. @ Tui anai, tơlơi arăng tơkeng kơ Yêsu Krist. Amĭ Ñu HʼMari hmâo djă kong laih hăng Yôsep, hlâo kơ gơñu dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt, HʼMari thâo ñu pô pi kian laih hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam. 
But Joseph, her husband, being [a] righteous [man], and unwilling to expose her publicly, purposed to have put her away secretly; @ Yôsep, rơkơi ñu jing sa čô mơnuih tơpă, ƀu kiăng ngă pơmlâo ñu ôh, tui anŭn ñu pơmĭn kiăng lui hăng tơlơi hơgơ̆m. 
but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to [thee] Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of [the] Holy Spirit. @ Samơ̆ tơdang ñu pơmĭn tui anŭn, anai nê hmâo sa čô ling jang hiam Khua Yang pơrơđah kơ ñu amăng tơlơi rơpơi hăng laĭ tui anai: “Ơ Yôsep, ană tơčo Đawit, anăm hwĭ ôh mă bĕ HʼMari jing bơnai ih, yua kơ ñu pi kian ană anŭn hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam. 
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for *he* shall save his people from their sins. @ Ñu či tơkeng sa čô ană đah rơkơi, laih anŭn brơi ih pơanăn Ñu jing Yêsu, yua kơ Ñu či pơklaih ƀing plei pla Ñu mơ̆ng tơlơi soh gơñu.” 
Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord, through the prophet, saying, @ Abih bang tơlơi anŭn truh kiăng pơsĭt tơlơi Khua Yang hmâo pơhiăp laih mơ̆ng amăng bah pô laĭ lui hlâo:
Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, 'God with us.' @ “Anai nê, sa čô dra hmŭm či pi kian laih anŭn ñu či tơkeng sa čô ană đah rơkơi,
Laih anŭn arăng či pơanăn ñu Êmanuel,”
kiăng laĭ: “Ơi Adai dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ta.” 
But Joseph, having awoke up from his sleep, did as the angel of [the] Lord had enjoined him, and took to [him] his wife, @ Tơ Yôsep mơdưh mơ̆ng pĭt, ñu ngă djơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi ling jang Khua Yang hmâo pơtă laih kơ ñu, ñu mă HʼMari jing hĭ bơnai ñu, 
and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus. @ samơ̆ ñu ƀu hmâo đih pĭt hrŏm hơbĭt hăng HʼMari ôh tơl HʼMari tơkeng rai sa čô ană đah rơkơi, laih anŭn pơanăn ñu jing Yêsu.
Now Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, behold magi from the east arrived at Jerusalem, saying, @ Tơdơi kơ HʼMari tơkeng kơ Yêsu pơ plei Betlêhem amăng tring Yuđa rơnŭk pơtao Hêrôt, anai nê hmâo ƀing kơhnâo mơ̆ng čar gah ngŏ truh pơ plei Yêrusalem laih anŭn tơña tui anai: 
Where is the king of the Jews that has been born? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to do him homage. @ “Pơpă anih arăng phrâo tơkeng laih pơtao kơ ƀing Yuđa lĕ? Yua kơ gơmơi ƀuh laih pơtŭ Ñu pơ gah ngŏ hlăk tơbiă đĭ, laih anŭn gơmơi rai kiăng kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ñu.”
But Herod the king having heard [of it], was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; @ Tơ pơtao Hêrôt hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, ñu laih anŭn abih bang plei Yêrusalem hmâo tơlơi rŭng răng. 
and, assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ should be born. @ Ñu iâu pơƀŭt abih bang ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt laih anŭn tơña kơ gơñu: “Pơpă anih arăng tơkeng kơ Krist lĕ?”
And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea; for thus it is written through the prophet: @ Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Pơ plei Betlêhem amăng tring Yuđa, yua kơ pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo čih laih tui anai:
And *thou* Bethlehem, land of Juda, art in no wise the least among the governors of Juda; for out of thee shall go forth a leader who shall shepherd my people Israel. @ ‘Ơ Betlêhem amăng čar Yuđa!

Yua kơ sa čô khua wai lăng či tơbiă rai mơ̆ng ih,

Then Herod, having secretly called the magi, inquired of them accurately the time of the star that was appearing; @ Hnŭn yơh, Hêrôt iâu rai ƀing kơhnâo hăng tơlơi hơgơ̆m kiăng kơ thâo klă rơđah mơ̆ng ƀing gơñu hơbin pơtŭ anŭn hmâo pơrơđah laih. 
and having sent them to Bethlehem, said, Go, search out accurately concerning the child, and when ye shall have found [him] bring me back word, so that *I* also may come and do him homage. @ Ñu pơkiaŏ nao gơñu pơ plei Betlêhem laih anŭn laĭ: “Nao bĕ tơña pơñen kơ čơđai anĕt anŭn, laih anŭn tơ ƀing gih ƀuh laih Ñu, laĭ brơi bĕ kơ kâo thâo, kiăng kơ kâo ăt nao kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ñu mơ̆n.”
And they having heard the king went their way; and lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them until it came and stood over the place where the little child was. @ Giơ̆ng kơ gơñu hmư̆ tơlơi pơtao Hêrôt laĭ, gơñu nao mơtam. Anai nê, pơtŭ gơñu hmâo ƀuh laih mơ̆ng gah ngŏ nao hlâo gah anăp gơñu truh pơ anih ană anĕt dŏ. Pơ anŭn pơtŭ dŏ hĭ. 
And when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. @ Tơ gơñu ƀuh pơtŭ anŭn, gơñu hơ̆k mơak biă mă. 
And having come into the house they saw the little child with Mary his mother, and falling down did him homage. And having opened their treasures, they offered to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh. @ Gơñu mŭt amăng sang laih anŭn ƀuh čơđai anĕt hăng amĭ Ñu HʼMari. Gơñu bon kơkuh kơ čơđai anĕt anŭn.

And being divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn, amăng tơlơi rơpơi, Ơi Adai pơthâo kơ gơñu anăm wơ̆t glaĭ pơ pơtao Hêrôt dơ̆ng ôh, hnŭn yơh gơñu glaĭ hĭ pơ čar gơñu pô hăng jơlan pơkŏn.
Now, they having departed, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph, saying, Arise, take to [thee] the little child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be there until I shall tell thee; for Herod will seek the little child to destroy it. @ Giơ̆ng kơ ƀing kơhnâo glaĭ laih, anai nê hmâo sa čô ling jang Khua Yang bơrơđah brơi kơ Yôsep amăng tơlơi rơpơi hăng laĭ: “Tơgŭ bĕ ih, mă ba čơđai anĕt laih anŭn amĭ ñu, nao đuaĭ kơdŏp bĕ pơ čar Êjip, laih anŭn dŏ hĭ pơ anŭn tơl kâo či pơthâo brơi kơ ih dơ̆ng; yua kơ pơtao Hêrôt či hơduah kiăng pơdjai hĭ čơđai anĕt anai.”
And, having arisen, he took to [him] the little child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt. @ Tui anŭn Yôsep tơgŭ tơdang mlam, mă ba čơđai anĕt laih anŭn amĭ ñu, hăng đuaĭ nao pơ čar Êjip. 
And he was there until the death of Herod, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son. @ Gơñu dŏ pơ anŭn tơl pơtao Hêrôt djai. Tơlơi anai kiăng pơsĭt tơlơi Khua Yang hmâo pơhiăp laih mơ̆ng pô laĭ lui hlâo tui anai: “Kâo hmâo iâu laih ană đah rơkơi Kâo tơbiă mơ̆ng čar Êjip.”
Then Herod, seeing that he had been mocked by the magi, was greatly enraged; and sent and slew all the boys which [were] in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time which he had accurately inquired from the magi. @ Tơ pơtao Hêrôt thâo ƀing kơhnâo hmâo pleč kơ ñu, ñu hil biă mă, laih anŭn ñu pơkiaŏ nao brơi arăng pơdjai hĭ abih bang ƀing čơđai đah rơkơi amăng plei Betlêhem laih anŭn tar ƀar tring anŭn čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng ƀing hmâo dua thŭn pơ yŭ, djơ̆ tui hăng hrơi blan ƀing kơhnâo hmâo pơthâo brơi laih kơ ñu.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying, @ Tui anŭn, tơlơi pô laĭ lui hlâo Yêrêmi pơhiăp dưi hmâo tơlơi pơsĭt yơh:
A voice has been heard in Rama, weeping, and great lamentation: Rachel weeping [for] her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not. @ “Arăng hmư̆ asăp ur amăng plei Rama,

But Herod having died, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, @ Tơ pơtao Hêrôt djai laih, sa čô ling jang Khua Yang pơƀuh brơi kơ Yôsep pơ čar Êjip amăng tơlơi rơpơi, ñu laĭ:

And he arose and took to [him] the little child and its mother, and came into the land of Israel; @ Hnŭn yơh Yôsep tơgŭ, mă ba čơđai anĕt hăng amĭ Ñu wơ̆t glaĭ pơ čar Israel.
but having heard that 'Archelaus reigns over Judaea, instead of Herod his father,' he was afraid to go there; and having been divinely instructed in a dream, he went away into the parts of Galilee, @ Samơ̆ tơ ñu hmư̆ Arkêlôs hrua ama ñu Hêrôt ngă pơtao wai lăng tring Yuđa, Yôsep hwĭ ƀu khĭn glaĭ ôh pơ anŭn; laih anŭn yua kơ Ơi Adai hmâo pơthâo kơ ñu dơ̆ng amăng tơlơi rơpơi, tui anŭn ñu nao hĭ pơ tring Galilê. 
and came and dwelt in a town called Nazareth; so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophets, He shall be called a Nazaraean. @ Pơ anŭn ñu dŏ amăng sa boh plei arăng pơanăn plei Nasaret, kiăng pơsĭt tơlơi ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo laĭ laih: “Arăng či iâu Ñu jing mơnuih plei Nasaret.”
Now in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea, @ Hlăk anŭn, Yôhan Ƀatem nao pơtô amăng tơdrŏn har čar Yuđa tui anai: 
and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh. @ “Kơhmal bĕ tơlơi soh ƀing gih, yua kơ Dêh Čar Pơtao Plei Hiam giăm truh laih yơh!” 
For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, saying, Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of [the] Lord, make straight his paths. @ Kơ Yôhan anŭn yơh pô laĭ lui hlâo Êsai hmâo laĭ laih tui anai:

‘Prăp pre bĕ jơlan brơi kơ Khua Yang.

And John himself had his garment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey. @ Yôhan buh ao blâu aseh samô laih anŭn hruă kơiăng ñu hăng hơdrăng klĭ. Ñu ƀơ̆ng kơtop laih anŭn ia hơni glai. 
Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan, @ Ƀing ană plei pla mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem, mơ̆ng tar ƀar kwar Yuđa, laih anŭn mơ̆ng abih kwar jĕ giăm ia krong Yurdan leng kơ nao pơ ñu soh sel.

But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath? @ Samơ̆ tơ ñu ƀuh lu ƀing Pharisi laih anŭn ƀing Sadusi rai tŭ ƀatem, ñu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ơ ƀing djuai ala tơpơ̆ng, hlơi pơthâo brơi kơ ƀing gih dưi đuaĭ kơdŏp mơ̆ng tơlơi Ơi Adai hil či truh? 
Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance. @ Brơi ƀing gih pơrơđah bĕ bruă hiam ƀing gih năng lăp hăng tơlơi ƀing gih kơhmal tơlơi soh, 
And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. @ laih anŭn anăm pơhiăp pơgao hăng laĭ: ‘Abraham yơh jing ơi adon gơmơi’; yua kơ kâo laĭ brơi kơ ƀing gih thâo, Ơi Adai ăt dưi pơjing rai mơ̆n ană tơčo Abraham mơ̆ng khul boh pơtâo anai. 
And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. @ Ră anai Ơi Adai ô laih jong ƀơi phŭn kơyâo; abih bang kơyâo ƀu mơboh rai boh hiam ôh, Ñu či drom hĭ laih anŭn glŏm lui amăng apui.

Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him; @ Hlăk anŭn, Yêsu tơbiă mơ̆ng kwar Galilê nao pơ Yôhan ƀơi ia krong Yurdan, kiăng kơ Yôhan ngă ƀatem kơ Ñu. 
but John urgently forbad him, saying, *I* have need to be baptised of thee; and comest *thou* to me? @ Yôhan khă Ñu laih anŭn laĭ: “Tui hăng tơlơi djơ̆ kâo yơh kiăng kơ Ih ngă ƀatem brơi kơ kâo, samơ̆ hyư̆m Ih rai pơ kâo lĕ?” 
But Jesus answering said to him, Suffer [it] now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers him. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ ñu: “Brơi ngă bĕ ră anai, yua kơ ƀing ta khŏm ngă pơgiơ̆ng hĭ abih bruă tơlơi tơpă.” Tui anŭn, Yôhan tŭ ư yơh. 
And Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him: @ Giơ̆ng kơ Yêsu tŭ ƀatem, hlăk Ñu tơgŭ đĭ mơ̆ng ia, ƀơi mông anŭn mơtam khul adai pŏk hĭ, Ñu ƀuh Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ơi Adai trŭn rai hrup hăng čĭm bơrơgơ̆m laih anŭn găm ƀơi Ñu.

Then Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil: @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Yang Bơngăt Hiam atăt ba Yêsu pơ tơdrŏn har brơi yang sat plư Ñu. 
and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he hungered. @ Giơ̆ng kơ Ñu ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă pă pluh hrơi laih anŭn pă pluh mlam, Ñu rơpa. 
And the tempter coming up to him said, If thou be Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread. @ Pô plư rai pơ Ñu laih anŭn laĭ tui anai: “Tơdah Ih jing Ană Ơi Adai, hrih bĕ khul boh pơtâo anai jing hĭ ƀañ tơpŭng.”
But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God's mouth. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih tui anai: ‘Ană mơnuih hơdip ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng yua mơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng đôč ôh, samơ̆ ăt hơdip yua mơ̆ng rĭm boh pơhiăp tơbiă rai mơ̆ng amăng bah Ơi Adai mơ̆n.’”
Then the devil takes him to the holy city, and sets him upon the edge of the temple, @ Yang sat atăt ba Ñu nao pơ Yêrusalem, plei rơgoh hiam, brơi Ñu dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi gor bơbŭng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, 
and says to him, If thou be Son of God cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee, and on [their] hands shall they bear thee, lest in anywise thou strike thy foot against a stone. @ laih anŭn laĭ kơ Ñu tui anai: “Tơdah Ih jing Ană Ơi Adai, kơdâo trŭn bĕ pơ lŏn; yua kơ Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih tui anai:

Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain, and shews him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory, @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, yang sat ba Ñu nao pơ čư̆ glong biă mă, kơčrâo brơi Ñu abih bang dêh čar pơtao ƀơi lŏn tơnah laih anŭn tơlơi guh kơang gơñu.

Then says Jesus to him, Get thee away, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt do homage to [the] Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ Satan, đuaĭ bĕ! Yua kơ Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih tui anai: ‘Brơi ih kơkuh pơpŭ bĕ kơ Khua Yang Ơi Adai ih, laih anŭn kơnơ̆ng mă bruă kơ hơjăn Ñu đôč.’”
Then the devil leaves him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him. @ Tui anŭn yang sat đuaĭ hĭ mơ̆ng Ñu, laih anŭn anai nê, hmâo ƀing ling jang rai laih anŭn buih bruă kơ Ñu mơtam.

From that time began Jesus to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh. @ Mơ̆ng hrơi anŭn, Yêsu čơdơ̆ng pơtô tui anai: “Kơhmal bĕ tơlơi soh ƀing gih, yua kơ dêh čar pơtao plei hiam giăm truh laih yơh.”
And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers; @ Tơdang Yêsu rơbat kơtuai hang ia rơsĭ Galilê, Ñu ƀuh dua čô adơi ayŏng jing Simôn, anăn pơkŏn dơ̆ng jing Pêtrôs, laih anŭn Andrê adơi ñu. Gơñu dŏ dăng hơñual amăng ia rơsĭ, yua kơ gơñu jing mơnuih mă bruă trah akan. 
and he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Đuaĭ tui Kâo bĕ, Kâo či pơjing ƀing gih jing mơnuih trah mơnuih.” 
And they, having left their trawl-nets, immediately followed him. @ Tañ mơtam gơñu lui hĭ hơñual, laih anŭn đuaĭ tui Yêsu.
And going on thence he saw other two brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their trawl-nets, and he called them; @ Tơdang Ñu nao ataih ƀiă mơ̆ng anŭn, Ñu ƀuh dua čô adơi ayŏng pơkŏn jing Yakơ, ană đah rơkơi Sêbêdê, laih anŭn adơi ñu Yôhan.

and they, having left the ship and their father, immediately followed him. @ Tañ mơtam gơñu lui hĭ sŏng wơ̆t hăng ama gơñu laih anŭn đuaĭ tui Yêsu.
And [Jesus] went round the whole [of] Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people. @ Yêsu hyu tar ƀar kwar Galilê, pơtô pơhrăm amăng sang bơjơnum laih anŭn pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ dêh čar pơtao, laih anŭn pơsuaih djŏp mơta tơlơi ruă nuă, tơlơi dju djuam duăm ruă ƀing ană plei pla. 
And his fame went out into the whole [of] Syria, and they brought to him all that were ill, suffering under various diseases and pains, and those possessed by demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them. @ Tui anŭn tơlơi hing ang kơ anăn Ñu bang hyu djŏp tring Siri.

And great crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and beyond the Jordan. @ Hmâo lu biă mă ƀing mơnuih đuaĭ tui Ñu mơ̆ng kwar Galilê, mơ̆ng tring Dêkapôlis, mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem, mơ̆ng kwar Yuđa, laih anŭn mơ̆ng kwar gah dih ia krong Yurdan.
But seeing the crowds, he went up into the mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him; @ Tơ Yêsu ƀuh khul mơnuih lu, Ñu đĭ nao pơ čư̆. Laih Ñu dŏ ber, ƀing ding kơna Ñu rai giăm pơ Ñu. 
and, having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying, @ Yêsu čơdơ̆ng pơhiăp laih anŭn pơtô tui anai:

Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for thus have they persecuted the prophets who were before you. @ Hơ̆k mơak bĕ, yua kơ pri ƀing gih prŏng biă mă amăng adai, yua kơ arăng hmâo ngă sat laih kơ ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo, hlâo kơ ƀing gih kar kaĭ mơ̆n.”
*Ye* are the salt of the earth; but if the salt have become insipid, wherewith shall it be salted? It is no longer fit for anything but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot by men. @ “Ƀing gih jing hra kơ lŏn tơnah; samơ̆ tơdah hra rơngiă hĭ mơnâo mơsĭn ñu, hyư̆m dưi ngă brơi ñu mơsĭn glaĭ dơ̆ng lĕ?

Think not that I am come to make void the law or the prophets; I am not come to make void, but to fulfil. @ “Anăm pơmĭn ôh Kâo rai kiăng pơrai hĭ tơlơi juăt ƀôdah tơlơi ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo čih. Kâo rai ƀu djơ̆ kiăng pơrai hĭ ôh, samơ̆ kiăng ngă pơsĭt hĭ. 
For verily I say unto you, Until the heaven and the earth pass away, one iota or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all come to pass. @ Yua kơ sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơl adai laih anŭn lŏn tơnah rơgao đŭt hĭ, sa boh tŭt ƀôdah sa ară gat amăng tơlơi juăt ƀu či rơgao hĭ ôh, tơl abih bang tơlơi anŭn či krĕp djơ̆ soh sel. 
Whosoever then shall do away with one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever shall practise and teach [them], *he* shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens. @ Tui anŭn hlơi pô ngă gao sa tơlơi anĕt hloh amăng khul tơlơi juăt anai, laih anŭn pơtô kơ arăng ngă kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n, ñu či jing pô anĕt hloh amăng dêh čar pơtao plei hiam.

For I say unto you, that unless your righteousness surpass [that] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of the heavens. @ Yua kơ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơdah tơlơi tơpă ƀing gih ƀu rơgao hloh kơ tơlơi tơpă ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt laih anŭn ƀing Pharisi, ƀing gih ƀu či mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao plei hiam ôh.”
Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not kill; but whosoever shall kill shall be subject to the judgment. @ “Ƀing gih hmâo hmư̆ laih tơlơi arăng pơtô kơ ƀing mơnuih rơnŭk đưm: ‘Anăm pơdjai mơnuih ôh; laih anŭn hlơi pô pơdjai mơnuih năng lăp kơ tơlơi phat kơđi.’ 
But *I* say unto you, that every one that is lightly angry with his brother shall be subject to the judgment; but whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be subject to [be called before] the sanhedrim; but whosoever shall say, Fool, shall be subject to the penalty of the hell of fire. @ Samơ̆ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hlơi pô hil kơ adơi ayŏng ñu ăt năng lăp tŭ tơlơi phat kơđi mơ̆n; hlơi pô laĭ kơ adơi ayŏng ñu ‘Ih mlŭk’ či năng lăp jao kơ tơpul khua phat kơđi; hlơi pô laĭ ‘Ih mlŭk hưt’ či năng lăp dŏ amăng war apui. 
If therefore thou shouldest offer thy gift at the altar, and there shouldest remember that thy brother has something against thee, @ Tui anŭn, tơdang ih pơyơr mơnơ̆ng pơyơr kơ Ơi Adai ƀơi kơƀang ngă yang, hlăk anŭn ih hơdơr kơ adơi ayŏng ih hlăk dŏ hmâo tơlơi hăng ih,

Make friends with thine adverse party quickly, whilst thou art in the way with him; lest some time the adverse party deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. @ Tañ pơsir bĕ hăng pô hmâo tơlơi hăng ih tơdang ih rơbat hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu ƀơi kơtuai jơlan, hwĭ dah ñu pơčŭt ih laih anŭn ba ih pơ khua phat kơđi, laih anŭn khua phat kơđi jao ih kơ khua wai sang mơnă, laih anŭn arăng krư̆ hĭ ih.

Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt not commit adultery. @ “Ƀing gih hmâo hmư̆ laih arăng laĭ đưm: ‘Anăm klĕ pyu ôh’. 
But *I* say unto you, that every one who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. @ Samơ̆ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hlơi pô lăng kơ đah kơmơi hăng tơlơi amoaih hưp kiăng ngă soh, ñu klĕ pyu laih hăng đah kơmơi anŭn amăng pran jua ñu. 
But if thy right eye be a snare to thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. @ Tơdah mơta gah hơnuă ih pơsoh ih, blač hĭ ñu laih anŭn glŏm hĭ pơ ataih; yua kơ hiam hloh kơ ih rơngiă sa črăn amăng drơi jan ih hăng arăng glŏm hĭ abih drơi jan ih dŏ amăng war apui. 
And if thy right hand be a snare to thee, cut it off and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members perish, and not thy whole body be cast into hell. @ Tơdah tơngan hơnuă ih pơsoh ih, čơ̆ng glŏm lui hĭ ñu pơ ataih; hiam hloh kơ ih rơngiă sa ƀĕ tơngan hăng abih drơi jan ih dŏ amăng war apui.”
It has been said too, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a letter of divorce. @ “Ƀing đưm hmâo laĭ mơ̆n: ‘Hlơi pô pơklaih lui bơnai ñu, brơi ñu čih kơ gơ̆ sa pŏk hră pơklaih lui.’ 
But *I* say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, except for cause of fornication, makes her commit adultery, and whosoever marries one that is put away commits adultery. @ Samơ̆ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, rĭm čô hlơi pô pơklaih lui bơnai ñu ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ bơnai ñu jing mơnuih rih răm ôh, ñu pơjing gơ̆ jing sa čô đah kơmơi klĕ pyu; laih anŭn hlơi pô dŏ sa čô đah kơmơi arăng pơklaih lui laih jing mơnuih klĕ pyu kar kaĭ mơ̆n.”
Again, ye have heard that it has been said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt render to the Lord what thou hast sworn. @ “Ƀing gih hmâo hmư̆ laih tơlơi arăng pơtô kơ ƀing mơnuih rơnŭk đưm: ‘Anăm ih ƀuăn rơ̆ng hăng tơlơi ƀlor ôh, samơ̆ brơi ih pơsĭt ƀơi anăp Khua Yang tơlơi ih hmâo ƀuăn rơ̆ng laih.’ 
But *I* say unto you, Do not swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is [the] throne of God; @ Samơ̆ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, anăm ƀuăn rơ̆ng hơgĕt ôh, thâo dah hăng adai, yua kơ adai jing gre pơtao kơ Ơi Adai,

Ye have heard that it has been said, Eye for eye and tooth for tooth. @ “Ƀing gih hmâo hmư̆ laih tơlơi arăng laĭ: ‘Mơta kla glaĭ kơ mơta, laih anŭn tơgơi kla glaĭ kơ tơgơi.’ 
But *I* say unto you, not to resist evil; but whoever shall strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other; @ Samơ̆ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih: Anăm pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ hăng mơnuih sat ƀai ôh. Samơ̆ tơdah arăng pah meng gah hơnuă ih, brơi ñu pah wơ̆t meng gah iao ih kar kaĭ mơ̆n.

And whoever will compel thee to go one mile, go with him two. @ Laih anŭn tơdah arăng pơgŏ ih rơbat sa wang, brơi ih rơbat hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu dua wang. 
To him that asks of thee give, and from him that desires to borrow of thee turn not away. @ Pha brơi bĕ kơ hlơi pô rơkâo mơ̆ng ih, laih anŭn anăm hơngah ôh kơ hlơi rơkâo čan mơ̆ng ih.”
Ye have heard that it has been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy. @  “Ƀing gih hmư̆ arăng laĭ: ‘Khăp bĕ kơ pô jum dar ih laih anŭn bơrơmŭt kơ ayăt ih.’ 
But *I* say unto you, Love your enemies, [bless those who curse you,] do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who [insult you and] persecute you, @ Samơ̆ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, khăp bĕ kơ ayăt ƀing gih, laih anŭn iâu laĭ brơi kơ ƀing ngă sat kơ ƀing gih,

For if ye should love those who love you, what reward have ye? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same? @ Yua kơ tơdah ƀing gih kơnơ̆ng khăp kơ ƀing khăp kơ ƀing gih đôč, hơgĕt tơlơi bơni ƀing gih či hmâo lĕ? Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă ƀing ring jia ăt ngă tui anŭn?

Be *ye* therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. @ Tui anŭn, brơi kơ ƀing gih jing klă tum kar hăng Ama ƀing gih amăng adai jing klă tum.”
Take heed not to do your alms before men to be seen of them, otherwise ye have no reward with your Father who is in the heavens. @ “Răng bĕ, tơdang ƀing gih ngă bruă hiam kơ arăng anăm ngă ôh yua kơ kiăng arăng ƀuh ƀing gih. Yua kơ tơdah ƀing gih ngă tui anŭn, ƀing gih ƀu či hmâo ôh tơlơi bơni mơ̆ng Ama ƀing gih amăng adai adih.
When therefore thou doest alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may have glory from men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. @ Tui anŭn tơdah ih pha brơi mơnơ̆ng pap kơ arăng, anăm ayŭp tơki ôh kar hăng ƀing pơrup mă ngă amăng sang bơjơnum laih anŭn ƀơi jơlan glung, kiăng kơ mơnuih pơpŭ bơni kơ gơñu.

And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites; for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets so that they should appear to men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. @ “Tơdang ƀing gih iâu laĭ, anăm ƀing gih ngă kar hăng ƀing plơ̆m ƀlor ôh; yua kơ gơñu khăp dŏ dơ̆ng iâu laĭ amăng sang bơjơnum laih anŭn ƀơi akiăng jơlan kiăng kơ arăng ƀuh gơñu.

And when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, downcast in countenance; for they disfigure their faces, so that they may appear fasting to men: verily I say unto you, They have their reward. @ “Laih anŭn tơ ƀing gih ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă, anăm bơrơđah ôh ƀô̆ mơta rơngot, kar hăng ƀing plơ̆m ƀlor; yua kơ gơñu bơrơđah ƀô̆ mơta rơngot kiăng kơ arăng thâo kơ gơñu ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă.

The lamp of the body is the eye; if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body will be light: @ “Mơta jing apui kơđen kơ drơi jan. Tui anŭn tơdah mơta ih hiam, abih drơi jan ih či bă hăng tơlơi bơngač. 
but if thine eye be wicked, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great the darkness! @ Samơ̆ tơdah mơta ih răm, abih drơi jan ih bă hăng tơlơi mơmŏt. Tui anŭn, tơdah tơlơi bơngač amăng ih jing hĭ mơmŏt, tơlơi mơmŏt anŭn prŏng biă mă yơh!”
No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and will love the other, or he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. @ “Sa čô mơnuih ƀu dưi ngă hlŭn kơ dua čô khua ôh; yua kơ ñu či bơrơmŭt kơ pô anai laih anŭn khăp kơ pô anŭn.

For this cause I say unto you, Do not be careful about your life, what ye should eat and what ye should drink; nor for your body what ye should put on.

Look at the birds of the heaven, that they sow not, nor reap, nor gather into granaries, and your heavenly Father nourishes them. Are *ye* not much more excellent than they? @ Lăng bĕ kơ čĭm amăng adai; gơñu ƀu hmâo jŭ pla ôh, kŏn hơpuă ƀôdah pơkom pioh amăng atông lơi, samơ̆ Ama ƀing gih amăng adai čem rong gơñu.

Judge not, that ye may not be judged; @ “Anăm phat kơđi kơ arăng ôh, kiăng kơ Ơi Adai ƀu phat kơđi ôh kơ ƀing gih.

Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you. @ “Rơkâo bĕ, ƀing gih či hmâo; kơsem bĕ, ƀing gih či ƀuh; khŏk bah amăng bĕ, Ơi Adai či pŏk brơi kơ ƀing gih yơh.

and if he ask a fish, will give him a serpent? @ Ƀôdah tơdah ană ñu rơkâo akan, ñu brơi hĭ ala kơ gơ̆? 
If therefore *ye*, being wicked, know [how] to give good gifts to your children, how much rather shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to them that ask of him? @ Tui anŭn, tơdah ƀing gih jing ƀing sat biă mă, ăt thâo brơi mơ̆n mơnơ̆ng hiam kơ ană bă ƀing gih, ƀai jai Ama ƀing gih amăng adai ƀu či pha brơi ôh hă mơnơ̆ng hiam brơi kơ hlơi pô rơkâo kơ Ñu?

Enter in through the narrow gate, for wide the gate and broad the way that leads to destruction, and many are they who enter in through it. @ “Mŭt bĕ ƀơi amăng jang gơniă; yua kơ amăng jang hluai laih anŭn jơlan prŏng ba nao kơ tơlơi răm rai, laih anŭn hmâo lu mơnuih mŭt ƀơi anŭn.

But beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but within are ravening wolves. @ “Răng bĕ kơ ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo ƀlor. Gơñu buh klĭ triu rai pơ ƀing gih, samơ̆ amăng lăm gơñu jing asâo tan juăt kĕ hek.

A good tree cannot produce bad fruits, nor a worthless tree produce good fruits. @ Phŭn kơyâo hiam ƀu dưi mơboh rai boh sat ôh; phŭn kơyâo sat kŏn dưi mơboh rai boh hiam lơi. 
Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire. @ Rĭm phŭn kơyâo ƀu mơboh rai boh hiam, arăng či drom laih anŭn glŏm hĭ ñu amăng apui. 
By their fruits then surely ye shall know them. @ Tui anŭn, yua mơ̆ng boh gơñu, ƀing gih či thâo krăn gơñu.”
Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that does the will of my Father who is in the heavens. @ “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh abih bang ƀing iâu Kâo: ‘Ơ Khua Yang, Ơ Khua Yang’ či mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao plei hiam, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng hlơi pô ngă tui tơlơi Ama Kâo pơ adai adih kiăng đôč.

Whoever therefore hears these my words and does them, I will liken him to a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock; @ “Tui anŭn, hlơi pô hmư̆ tơlơi Kâo pơhiăp laih anŭn tui gưt, ñu anŭn jing kar hăng sa čô mơnuih kơhnâo pơdơ̆ng sang ñu ƀơi boh pơtâo. 
and the rain came down, and the streams came, and the winds blew and fell upon that house, and it did not fall, for it had been founded upon the rock. @ Wơ̆t dah hmâo hơjan, ia lip laih anŭn angĭn rơbŭ kơtang thut ngă kơ sang anŭn, samơ̆ sang anŭn ƀu rơbuh hĭ ôh, yua kơ arăng pơdơ̆ng laih ñu ƀơi boh pơtâo.
And every one who hears these my words and does not do them, he shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand; @ Samơ̆ hlơi pô hmư̆ tơlơi Kâo pơhiăp, samơ̆ ƀu tui gưt ôh, ñu anŭn jing kar hăng sa čô mơnuih mlŭk pơdơ̆ng sang ñu ƀơi lŏn čuah.

And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, the crowds were astonished at his doctrine, @ Tơ Yêsu pơhiăp hơdôm tơlơi anŭn giơ̆ng laih, ƀing mơnuih lu hling hlang kơ tơlơi Ñu pơtô,

And when he had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. @ Tơ Yêsu trŭn mơ̆ng čư̆, hmâo lu mơnuih tui Ñu. 
And behold, a leper came up to [him] and did him homage, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou art able to cleanse me. @ Anai nê, hmâo sa čô mơnuih djơ̆ phŭng nao pơ Ñu, bon ƀơi anăp Ñu, laih anŭn laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, tơdah Ih kiăng, Ih dưi pơrơgoh kâo yơh.”
And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. @ Yêsu yơr tơngan, ruaih ñu, laih anŭn laĭ: “Kâo kiăng yơh, rơgoh bĕ!” Tañ mơtam phŭng ñu rơgoh ƀhiao. 
And Jesus says to him, See thou tell no man, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses ordained, for a testimony to them. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Răng bĕ, anăm ră ruai tơlơi anai kơ arăng ôh, samơ̆ nao pơdah bĕ ih pô kơ khua ngă yang laih anŭn pơyơr mơnơ̆ng ngă yang tui hăng Môis hmâo pơtă laih, jing sa tơlơi ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ abih bang mơnuih.”
And when he had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, beseeching him, @ Tơdang Yêsu mŭt pơ plei Kapernum, sa čô khua tơhan wai sa rơtuh čô rai kơwưh rơkâo kơ Ñu 
and saying, Lord, my servant lies paralytic in the house, suffering grievously. @ laih anŭn laĭ: “Ơ Khua, ding kơna kâo dŏ đih amăng sang rơwen ruă kơtang biă mă.”
And Jesus says to him, *I* will come and heal him. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Kâo či nao pơsuaih ñu.”
And the centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not fit that thou shouldest enter under my roof; but only speak a word, and my servant shall be healed. @ Samơ̆ khua tơhan anŭn laĭ glaĭ kơ Yêsu dơ̆ng: “Ơ Khua, kâo ƀu năng lăp ôh jum ih mŭt amăng sang kâo; kơnơ̆ng rơkâo kơ Ih pơhiăp sa boh đôč, laih anŭn ding kơna kâo či suaih yơh. 
For *I* also am a man under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say to this [one], Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does it. @ Yua kơ kâo pô dŏ gah yŭ tơlơi dưi kơ arăng mơ̆n, laih anŭn kâo ăt hmâo mơ̆n lu ƀing tơhan dŏ gah yŭ kơ tơlơi dưi kâo.

And when Jesus heard it, he wondered, and said to those who followed, Verily I say unto you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith. @ Tơ Yêsu hmư̆ khua tơhan anŭn pơhiăp, Ñu hling hlang laih anŭn laĭ kơ ƀing tui ñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, wơ̆t amăng čar Israel Kâo aka ƀuh djơ̆ ôh mơnuih hmâo tơlơi đaŏ prŏng kar hăng anŭn. 
But I say unto you, that many shall come from [the] rising and setting [sun], and shall lie down at table with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens; @ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hmâo lu mơnuih či rai mơ̆ng gah ngŏ, mơ̆ng gah yŭ laih anŭn dŏ ber kơ tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă mơñum hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Abraham, Isak, laih anŭn Yakôp amăng dêh čar pơtao plei hiam,

And Jesus said to the centurion, Go, and as thou hast believed, be it to thee. And his servant was healed in that hour. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ khua tơhan: “Nao bĕ, brơi tơlơi anŭn truh tui hăng tơlơi ih đaŏ.” Ƀơi mông anŭn mơtam ding kơna ñu suaih.
And when Jesus had come to Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law laid down and in a fever; @ Tơ Yêsu mŭt amăng sang Pêtrôs, Ñu ƀuh tơhmua đah kơmơi Pêtrôs ruă pơgrŭn dŏ đih ƀơi sưng.

And when the evening was come, they brought to him many possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were ill; @ Klam anŭn, arăng ba nao pơ Yêsu lu čô mơnuih yang sat ngă. Ñu puh pơđuaĭ hĭ ƀing yang sat anŭn hăng sa boh pơhiăp, laih anŭn pơsuaih abih bang ƀing duăm ruă.

And Jesus, seeing great crowds around him, commanded to depart to the other side. @ Tơ Yêsu ƀuh ƀing lu jum dar Ñu, Ñu pơđar brơi găn nao pơ hang gah dih ia dơnao. 
And a scribe came up and said to him, Teacher, I will follow thee whithersoever thou mayest go. @ Hmâo sa čô nai pơtô tơlơi juăt rai laih anŭn laĭ hăng Ñu: “Ơ Nai, pơpă Ih nao kâo či tui Ih pơ anŭn yơh.”
And Jesus says to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven roosting-places; but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Khul pơja hmâo amăng, khul čĭm brĭm amăng adai hmâo hruh, samơ̆ Ană Mơnuih ƀu hmâo ôh anih đăl akŏ.”
But another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go away and bury my father. @ Hmâo sa čô ding kơna pơkŏn dơ̆ng laĭ hăng Ñu: “Ơ Khua, brơi kâo dơr hĭ ama kâo hlâo amơĭ.”
But Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Đuaĭ tui Kâo bĕ, laih anŭn lui ƀing djai dơr mă mơnuih djai gơñu pô.”
And he went on board ship and his disciples followed him; @ Tơ Yêsu đĭ amăng sŏng laih, ƀing ding kơna Ñu tui Ñu. 
and behold, [the water] became very agitated on the sea, so that the ship was covered by the waves; but *he* slept. @ Anai nê, hmâo rơbŭ kơthel ƀơi ia rơsĭ tơl ia poh yă gom sŏng giăm pơtrăm hĭ; samơ̆ Yêsu dŏ pĭt. 
And the disciples came and awoke him, saying, Lord save: we perish. @ Ƀing ding kơna nao râo Ñu, laĭ: “Ơ Khua, pơklaih gơmơi bĕ; ƀing ta djai yơh!”
And he says to them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then, having arisen, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ơ ƀing mơnuih tơlơi đaŏ anĕt, yua hơgĕt ƀing gih hwĭ?” Ñu tơgŭ mơtam, khă rơbŭ hăng ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn dŏ rơiăt lơleh mơtam.

And there met him, when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, two possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs, exceeding dangerous, so that no one was able to pass by that way. @ Tơ Yêsu truh laih pơ hang gah adih amăng čar ƀing Gadara, dua čô mơnuih yang sat ngă rai mơ̆ng pơsat bưp Ñu.

Now there was, a great way off from them, a herd of many swine feeding; @ Ataih ƀiă mơ̆ng anŭn hmâo lu bơbui hlăk hyu ƀơ̆ng.

And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn so long as the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom will have been taken away from them, and then they will fast. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Dưi mơ̆ ƀing arăng jak kơ tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă dŏ rơkơi bơnai kơ-ŭ uăn tơdang pô han tao ăt dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu?

But the Pharisees said, He casts out the demons through the prince of the demons. @ Samơ̆ ƀing Pharisi laĭ: “Hăng tơlơi mơyang khua yang sat Ñu puh pơđuaĭ ƀing yang sat.”
And Jesus went round all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness. @ Yêsu hyu amăng abih bang plei prŏng plei anĕt, pơhrăm amăng sang bơjơnum, laih anŭn pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ dêh čar pơtao plei hiam, laih anŭn pơsuaih djŏp mơta tơlơi duăm ruă.

And it came to pass when Jesus had finished commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and preach in their cities. @ Tơ Yêsu pơtô kơ ƀing pluh dua čô khua ding kơna Ñu giơ̆ng laih, Ñu đuaĭ mơ̆ng anŭn hăng nao pơhrăm laih anŭn pơtô amăng abih bang plei gơñu.
But John, having heard in the prison the works of the Christ, sent by his disciples, @ Tơdang Yôhan dŏ amăng sang mơnă, ñu hmư̆ arăng ră ruai hơdôm bruă Yang Krist ngă. Hnŭn yơh ñu pơkiaŏ nao ƀing ding kơna ñu

And Jesus answering said to them, Go, report to John what ye hear and see. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Nao laĭ bĕ kơ Yôhan hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih hmâo hmư̆ laih anŭn ƀuh:

But as they went [away], Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed moved about by the wind? @ Tơdang ƀing anŭn glaĭ, Yêsu čơdơ̆ng pơhiăp kơ ƀing mơnuih lu tơlơi djơ̆ kơ Yôhan: “Hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih hmâo nao lăng laih amăng tơdrŏn har?

Verily I say to you, that there is not arisen among [the] born of women a greater than John the baptist.

For John has come neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon. @ Yua kơ Yôhan hmâo rai laih ƀu ƀơ̆ng huă kŏn mơñum lơi, laih anŭn gơñu laĭ: ‘Ñu hmâo yang sat ngă.’

Then began he to reproach the cities in which most of his works of power had taken place, because they had not repented. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu čơdơ̆ng ƀuah ƀing ană plei amăng ƀing plei Ñu hmâo ngă laih lu tơlơi mơsêh mơyang, yua kơ gơñu ƀu kơhmal ôh tơlơi soh.

At that time, Jesus answering said, I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes. @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu laĭ tui anai: “Kâo bơni hơơč kơ Ih, Ơ Ama, Khua Yang kơ adai hăng lŏn tơnah, yua kơ Ih hmâo pơdŏp tơlơi anai kơ ƀing kơhnâo laih anŭn ƀing rơgơi, samơ̆ bơrơđah brơi laih kơ ƀing čơđai anĕt;

At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears and to eat. @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu rơbat găn hmua pơdai tơpŭng ƀơi hrơi saƀat. Ƀing ding kơna Ñu rơpa, laih anŭn gơñu čơdơ̆ng ruač ƀơ̆ng amŭng pơdai. 
But the Pharisees, seeing [it], said to him, Behold, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on sabbath. @ Tơ ƀing Pharisi ƀuh tơlơi anŭn, gơñu laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Lăng bĕ ƀing ding kơna Ih ngă tơlơi ƀu phiăn ngă ôh amăng hrơi saƀat.” 
But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him? @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih aka ƀu đŏk ôh hă kơ bruă Đawit hmâo ngă tơdang ñu laih anŭn ƀing nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu rơpa?

For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath. @ Yua kơ Ană Mơnuih jing khua kơ hrơi saƀat.”
And, going away from thence, he came into their synagogue. @ Yêsu đuaĭ mơ̆ng anŭn laih anŭn mŭt amăng sang bơjơnum. 
And behold, there was a man having his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him. @ Anai nê, pơ anŭn hmâo sa čô đah rơkơi kro sa ƀĕ tơngan.

But he said to them, What man shall there be of you who has one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it and raise [it] up? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Hlơi pô amăng ƀing gih hmâo sa drơi triu laih anŭn triu anŭn lĕ amăng luh dlam amăng hrơi saƀat, ñu ƀu či mă dui đĭ pơ gah rơngiao ôh hă?

Then he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and it was restored sound as the other. @ Laih anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ đah rơkơi anŭn: “Yơr bĕ tơngan ih” Gơ̆ yơr yơh, laih anŭn tơngan gơ̆ suaih jing hiam kar hăng tơngan pơkŏn.

But when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and does not find [it]. @ “Tơ yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak tơbiă laih mơ̆ng sa čô mơnuih, ñu găn nao lu anih thu hơduah sem anih kiăng pơdơi, samơ̆ ƀu hmâo ôh. 
Then he says, I will return to my house whence I came out; and having come, he finds [it] unoccupied, swept, and adorned. @ Tui anŭn ñu laĭ: ‘Kâo či wơ̆t glaĭ dŏ amăng sang kâo phrâo tơbiă laih.’ Laih anŭn tơ ñu truh ñu ƀuh sang anŭn jing hŏng đôč, kih agaih laih, laih anŭn prăp rơmet hiam djeh djong. 
Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also. @ Laih anŭn ñu nao dơ̆ng jak ba hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu tơjuh čô yang sat pơkŏn sat hloh kơ ñu; gơñu mŭt dŏ amăng anŭn.

But while he was yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him. @ Tơdang Yêsu ăt dŏ pơhiăp hăng ƀing mơnuih lu, amĭ Ñu hăng ƀing adơi ayŏng ñu dŏ pơ gah rơngiao kiăng pơhiăp bĭt hăng Ñu.

But he answering said to him that spoke to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ pô laĭ hăng Ñu: “Hlơi jing amĭ Kâo? Laih anŭn hlơi jing ƀing adơi ayŏng Kâo?” 
And, stretching out his hand to his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren; @ Ñu črâo kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu laih anŭn laĭ: “Anai yơh amĭ Kâo laih anŭn adơi ayŏng Kâo!

And that [same] day Jesus went out from the house and sat down by the sea. @ Amăng hrơi anŭn mơ̆n, Yêsu tơbiă mơ̆ng sang laih anŭn dŏ ber ƀơi hang ia rơsĭ. 
And great crowds were gathered together to him, so that going on board ship himself he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the shore. @ Laih anŭn ƀing mơnuih lu rai pơtŭm jum dar Ñu, tui anŭn Ñu đĭ amăng sŏng laih anŭn dŏ ber; laih anŭn abih ƀing mơnuih lu dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi hang. 
And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went out to sow: @ Ñu pơtô kơ ƀing gơñu lu mơta hăng tơlơi bơhmutu, laĭ: “Hmâo sa čô mơnuih nao sai pơjeh ñu. 
and as he sowed, some [grains] fell along the way, and the birds came and devoured them; @ Tơdang ñu sai hmâo đơđa pơjeh lĕ ƀơi rŏk jơlan laih anŭn čĭm rai čoh ƀơ̆ng hĭ pơjeh anŭn. 
and others fell upon the rocky places where they had not much earth, and immediately they sprang up out of [the ground] because of not having [any] depth of earth, @ Pơjeh pơkŏn lĕ amăng anih lŏn boh pơtâo, hmâo kơnơ̆ng ƀiă lŏn đôč, laih anŭn pơjeh čăt mơtam, yua kơ lŏn ƀu kơpal ôh; 
but when the sun rose they were burned up, and because of not having [any] root were dried up; @ Samơ̆ tơ yang hrơi ƀlĕ, pơjeh anŭn gliu hĭ; laih anŭn yua kơ ƀu hmâo akha ôh, gơñu kro yơh. 
and others fell upon the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them; @ Pơjeh pơkŏn lĕ amăng anih drơi. Drơi čăt đĭ glong laih anŭn ket hĭ pơjeh anŭn. 
and others fell upon the good ground, and produced fruit, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty. @ Pơjeh pơkŏn lĕ amăng anih lŏn hiam laih anŭn mơboh, hmâo đơđa sa sar jing hĭ sa rơtuh, hmâo đơđa jing hĭ năm pluh, hmâo đơđa jing hĭ klâo pluh. 
He that has ears, let him hear. @ Hlơi pô hmâo tơngia, hmư̆ bĕ!”
And the disciples came up and said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables? @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ƀing ding kơna nao tơña kơ Yêsu: “Hyư̆m Ih pơhiăp hăng ƀing gơñu hăng tơlơi bơhmutu?”
And he answering said to them, Because to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given; @ Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih mă tŭ laih tơlơi thâo hluh tơlơi yom hơgơ̆m kơ dêh čar pơtao plei hiam, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu hmâo ôh. 
for whoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall be caused to be in abundance; but he who has not, even what he has shall be taken away from him. @ Yua kơ Ơi Adai či brơi thim kơ hlơi pô hmâo laih, laih anŭn ñu či hmâo lu rơbeh; samơ̆ hlơi pô ƀu hmâo ôh, arăng či sua mă hĭ wơ̆t kơ hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng ñu hmâo laih. 
For this cause I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear nor understand; @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh Kâo yua tơlơi bơhmutu pơhiăp hăng gơñu, wơ̆t dah gơñu lăng samơ̆ ƀu ƀuh ôh, gơñu pơđing tơngia samơ̆ ƀu hmư̆ ôh, kŏn gơñu thâo hluh lơi. 
and in them is filled up the prophecy of Esaias, which says, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and beholding ye shall behold and not see; @ Gơñu hmâo ngă pơsĭt tơlơi Êsai hmâo laĭ lui hlâo tui anai:
‘Ƀing gih či pơđing tơngia hmư̆, samơ̆ ƀu thâo hluh ôh;
Ƀing gih či lăng samơ̆ ƀu thâo ƀuh ôh.
for the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes as asleep, lest they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. @ Yua kơ pran jua ƀing ană plei pla anai jing kơpĭl laih,

But blessed are *your* eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear; @ Samơ̆ mơyun hiam yơh kơ mơta gih yua kơ dưi thâo ƀuh; mơyun hiam yơh kơ tơngia gih yua kơ dưi thâo hmư̆. 
for verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous [men] have desired to see the things which ye behold and did not see [them], and to hear the things which ye hear and did not hear [them]. @ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih sĭt biă mă, hmâo lu pô laĭ lui hlâo hăng lu mơnuih tơpă kiăng ƀuh hơdôm tơlơi gih ƀuh ră anai samơ̆ gơñu ƀu dưi ƀuh ôh.

*Ye*, therefore, hear the parable of the sower. @ “Tui anŭn hmư̆ bĕ tơlơi pơblang tơlơi bơhmutu kơ pô sai pơjeh anŭn. 
From every one who hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand [it], the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in his heart: this is he that is sown by the wayside. @ Hlơi pô hmư̆ tơlơi pơhiăp kơ dêh čar pơtao plei hiam laih anŭn ƀu thâo hluh ôh, yang sat rai mă hĭ hơgĕt tơlơi arăng sai laih amăng pran jua ñu; anŭn jing pơjeh sai lĕ ƀơi jơlan. 
But he that is sown on the rocky places this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, @ Pơjeh arăng sai lĕ ƀơi ngŏ lŏn boh pơtâo, jing pô hmư̆ tơlơi pơhiăp laih anŭn hăng tơlơi hơ̆k mơak mă tŭ mơtam, 
but has no root in himself, but is for a time only; and when tribulation or persecution happens on account of the word, he is immediately offended. @ samơ̆ boh pơhiăp ƀu hmâo akha ôh amăng ñu, ñu dŏ kơjăp kơnơ̆ng ƀiă đôč. Laih anŭn tơdah hmâo tơlơi tơnap ƀôdah tơlơi ngă sat truh yua kơ tơlơi pơhiăp, ñu lui wir mơtam. 
And he that is sown among the thorns this is he who hears the word, and the anxious care of this life, and the deceit of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. @ Pơjeh sai lĕ ƀơi anih drơi, jing pô hmư̆ tơlơi pơhiăp, samơ̆ tơlơi ƀlơ̆ng bơngơ̆t kơ tơlơi hơdip rơnŭk anai laih anŭn tơlơi plư tơbiă mơ̆ng tơlơi kiăng kơ tơlơi pơdrŏng sah ket hĭ tơlơi pơhiăp, laih anŭn ñu ƀu hmâo mơboh ôh. 
But he that is sown upon the good ground this is he who hears and understands the word, who bears fruit also, and produces, one a hundred, one sixty, and one thirty. @ Bơ kơ pơjeh arăng sai laih ƀơi lŏn hiam, jing pô hmư̆ tơlơi pơhiăp laih anŭn thâo hluh. Sĭt biă mă ñu mơboh tơl sa asar pơjeh jing hĭ sa rơtuh asar dơ̆ng, đơđa jing hĭ năm pluh, đơđa jing hĭ klâo pluh.”
Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field; @ Yêsu pơtô kơ gơñu tơlơi bơhmutu pơkŏn: “Dêh čar pơtao plei hiam dưi pơhmu kar hăng sa čô đah rơkơi sai pơjeh hiam amăng hmua ñu, 
but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel amongst the wheat, and went away. @ samơ̆ tơdang arăng pĭt, pô ayăt ñu rai sai pơjeh rơ̆k sat amăng pơdai tơpŭng laih anŭn đuaĭ hĭ. 
But when the blade shot up and produced fruit, then appeared the darnel also. @ Tơdah pơdai tơpŭng čăt đĭ glong laih anŭn hroh, rơ̆k sat ăt bơrơđah mơ̆n. 
And the bondmen of the householder came up and said to him, Sir, hast thou not sown good seed in thy field? whence then has it darnel? @ Ƀing ding kơna pô hmua anŭn rai laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Ơ Khua, ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă ih sai pơjeh hiam amăng hmua ih? Hyư̆m hmâo hĭ rơ̆k sat lĕ?’ 
And he said to them, A man [that is] an enemy has done this. And the bondmen said to him, Wilt thou then that we should go and gather it [up]? @ Ñu laĭ kơ gơñu: ‘Sa čô ayăt yơh ngă tơlơi anŭn.’ Ƀing ding kơna laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Ih kiăng mơ̆ gơmơi nao buč hĭ rơ̆k anŭn?’ 
But he said, No; lest [in] gathering the darnel ye should root up the wheat with it. @ Samơ̆ ñu laĭ: ‘Anăm ôh, hwĭ kơ tơdang ƀing gih buč rơ̆k sat anŭn ƀing gih buč djơ̆ hĭ wơ̆t pơdai tơpŭng hrŏm hơbĭt mơ̆n. 
Suffer both to grow together unto the harvest, and in time of the harvest I will say to the harvestmen, Gather first the darnel, and bind it into bundles to burn it; but the wheat bring together into my granary. @ Lui abih dua anŭn glong đĭ hrŏm hơbĭt tơl truh bơyan hơpuă; laih anŭn ƀơi bơyan hơpuă kâo či pơtă kơ ƀing hơpuă, buč hĭ rơ̆k sat hlâo, pŏ glaĭ laih anŭn čuh hĭ, samơ̆ pơƀŭt pơdai tơpŭng pioh amăng atông kâo.’”
Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard [seed] which a man took and sowed in his field; @ Yêsu pơtô kơ gơñu hăng tơlơi bơhmutu pơkŏn dơ̆ng, laĭ: “Dêh čar pơtao plei hiam jing kar hăng sa asar pơjeh añăm bơi, sa čô mơnuih mă laih anŭn sai amăng hmua ñu. 
which is less indeed than all seeds, but when it is grown is greater than herbs, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches. @ Ñu jing asar pơjeh anĕt hloh kơ abih bang pơjeh, samơ̆ tơ ñu čăt glong laih, ñu jing prŏng hloh kơ abih bang phŭn añăm pơtăm pơkŏn laih anŭn jing hĭ ania kơyâo, tơl čĭm brĭm rai ngă hruh ƀơi than ñu.”
He spoke another parable to them: The kingdom of the heavens is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until it had been all leavened. @ Ñu pơtô kơ gơñu hăng tơlơi bơhmutu pơkŏn dơ̆ng: “Dêh čar pơtao plei hiam jing kar hăng tơpơi, sa čô đah kơmơi mă pơlŭk hăng klâo hơnơ̆ng tơpŭng tơl tơpŭng anŭn blang hĭ abih.”
All these things Jesus spoke to the crowds in parables, and without a parable he did not speak to them, @ Yêsu pơtô abih tơlơi anŭn kơ ƀing lu hăng tơlơi bơhmutu soh sel. Ƀu hmâo sa tơlơi pơtô hơgĕt ôh Ñu ƀu yua tơlơi bơhmutu kiăng pơtô kơ ƀing gơñu. 
so that that should be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things hidden from [the] world's foundation. @ Tơlơi anŭn kiăng pơsĭt tơlơi pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo pơhiăp laih tui anai:
“Kâo či ha pơhiăp hăng tơlơi bơhmutu,
Kâo či pơhaih tơlơi hmâo pơdŏp laih čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng hrơi hrih pơjing lŏn tơnah.”
Then, having dismissed the crowds, he went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Expound to us the parable of the darnel of the field. @ Giơ̆ng Ñu brơi ƀing mơnuih lu anŭn glaĭ, Khua Yang Yêsu mŭt amăng sang. Ƀing ding kơna Ñu nao pơ Ñu, laĭ: “Rơkâo kơ Ih pơblang brơi kơ gơmơi tơlơi bơhmutu kơ rơ̆k sat amăng hmua.”
But he answering said, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man, @ Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Pô sai pơjeh hiam jing Ană Mơnuih, 
and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom, but the darnel are the sons of the evil [one]; @ hmua jing lŏn tơnah, pơjeh hiam jing ƀing ană kơ dêh čar pơtao plei hiam, rơ̆k sat jing ƀing ană yang sat, 
and the enemy who has sowed it is the devil; and the harvest is [the] completion of [the] age, and the harvestmen are angels. @ pô ayăt sai pơjeh rơ̆k sat anŭn jing yang sat, bơyan hơpuă jing rơnŭk hnal tuč, laih anŭn ƀing hơpuă jing ƀing ling jang Ơi Adai. 
As then the darnel is gathered and is burned in the fire, thus it shall be in the completion of the age. @ Kar hăng arăng mă rơ̆k sat anŭn, pơƀŭt laih anŭn čuh hĭ amăng apui, arăng či ngă kar hăng tui anŭn mơ̆n ƀơi hrơi hnal tuč rơnŭk. 
The Son of man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all offences, and those that practise lawlessness; @ Ană Mơnuih či pơkiaŏ nao ƀing ling jang Ñu, laih anŭn gơñu či duñ hĭ abih bang ƀing pơsoh arăng laih anŭn ƀing ngă tơlơi sat mơ̆ng dêh čar pơtao Ñu, 
and they shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. @ laih anŭn glŏm hĭ gơñu amăng tơpur apui prŏng. Ƀơi anih anŭn či hmâo tơlơi čŏk hia hăng tơlơi kĕ tơgơi. 
Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He that has ears, let him hear. @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing mơnuih tơpă či pơčrang kar hăng yang hrơi amăng dêh čar pơtao Ama gơñu. Hlơi pô hmâo tơngia, brơi ñu hmư̆ bĕ.”
The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hid in the field, which a man having found has hid, and for the joy of it goes and sells all whatever he has, and buys that field. @ “Dêh čar pơtao adai jing kar hăng dram gơnam yom arăng pơdŏp hĭ amăng sa blah hmua. Sa čô mơnuih ƀuh dram gơnam yom anŭn ñu pơdŏp hĭ, laih anŭn hăng tơlơi hơ̆k kơdơ̆k ñu nao sĭ hĭ abih bang mơnơ̆ng ñu hmâo kiăng blơi hmua anŭn.”
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls; @ “Kar kaĭ mơ̆n dêh čar pơtao plei hiam jing kar hăng sa čô sĭ mia hyu hơduah boh pơtâo ačung. 
and having found one pearl of great value, he went and sold all whatever he had and bought it. @ Tơ ñu hmâo ƀuh laih sa sar boh pơtâo ačung yom biă mă, ñu nao sĭ hĭ abih mơnơ̆ng ñu hmâo kiăng blơi boh pơtâo ačung anŭn.”
Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a seine which has been cast into the sea, and which has gathered together of every kind, @ “Kar kaĭ mơ̆n dêh čar pơtao plei hiam jing kar hăng sa blah hơñual arăng trah amăng ia rơsĭ djơ̆ djŏp mơta akan. 
which, when it has been filled, having drawn up on the shore and sat down, they gathered the good into vessels and cast the worthless out. @ Tơ hơñual bă laih, arăng dui đĭ hơñual pơ hang. Gơñu dŏ ber ruah mă akan hiam pioh amăng bai, samơ̆ glŏm hĭ akan sat. 
Thus shall it be in the completion of the age: the angels shall go forth and sever the wicked from the midst of the just, @ Kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n ƀơi hrơi hnal tuč rơnŭk. Ƀing ling jang Ơi Adai či rai laih anŭn pơkah pơpha, mă hĭ ƀing sat mơ̆ng ƀing tơpă, 
and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. @ laih anŭn glŏm hĭ gơñu amăng tơpur apui prŏng. Ƀơi anŭn gơñu či čŏk hia hăng kĕ tơgơi.”
Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these things? They say to him, Yea, [Lord]. @ “Ƀing gih thâo hluh laih mơ̆ abih tơlơi anŭn?”
Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ, thâo hluh mơ̆n.”
And he said to them, For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a man [that is] a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Yua kơ anŭn, rĭm čô nai pơtô tơlơi juăt arăng hmâo pơhrăm laih gơñu kơ dêh čar pơtao plei hiam, jing kar hăng sa čô pô sang ba tơbiă dram gơnam yom phrâo wơ̆t so mơ̆ng anih kong ngăn ñu.”
And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these parables he withdrew thence. @ Tơ Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi bơhmutu anŭn giơ̆ng laih, Ñu đuaĭ mơ̆ng anih anŭn. 
And having come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Whence has this [man] this wisdom and these works of power? @ Ñu glaĭ pơ plei Ñu pô laih anŭn pơtô amăng sang bơjơnum.

And they were offended in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honour, unless in his country and in his house. @ Laih anŭn gơñu tơhnač yua kơ Yêsu. Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo tơlơi pơpŭ tar ƀar anih, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng plei pla Ñu laih anŭn sang anŏ Ñu pô đôč ƀu hmâo tơlơi pơpŭ ôh kơ Ñu.” 
And he did not there many works of power, because of their unbelief. @ Laih anŭn Ñu ƀu ngă lu tơlơi mơsêh mơyang ôh ƀơi anŭn, yua kơ gơñu ƀu đaŏ ôh.
At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, @ Hlăk anŭn pơtao Hêrôt, pô wai lăng kwar Galilê, hmư̆ arăng ră ruai tơlơi hing ang Yêsu. 
and said to his servants, This is John the baptist: *he* is risen from the dead, and because of this these works of power display their force in him. @ Ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna ñu: “Anai jing Yôhan Ƀatem, pô hmâo hơdip glaĭ laih mơ̆ng ƀing djai.

For Herod had seized John, and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother. @ Yua kơ pơtao Hêrôt hmâo brơi arăng mă čaŏ laih anŭn krư̆ Yôhan amăng sang mơnă yua kơ bruă HʼHêrôđias, bơnai Philip adơi ñu. 
For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her. @ Yua kơ Yôhan hmâo laĭ kơ ñu: “Ƀu phiăn ôh ih mă đah kơmơi anŭn jing hĭ bơnai ih.” 
And [while] desiring to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they held him for a prophet. @ Pơtao Hêrôt kiăng pơdjai hĭ Yôhan, samơ̆ ñu hwĭ kơ ƀing ană plei, yua kơ gơñu yap Yôhan jing sa čô pô laĭ lui hlâo.
But when Herod's birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod; @ Samơ̆ ƀơi hrơi arăng pơhơdơr hrơi tơkeng kơ pơtao Hêrôt, ană dra HʼHêrôđias suang ƀơi anăp ƀing tuai dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă. Gơ̆ ngă bơmơak kơ pơtao Hêrôt,

and his head was brought upon a dish, and was given to the damsel, and she carried [it] to her mother. @ laih anŭn arăng djă ba akŏ Yôhan amăng sa boh prang brơi kơ dra anŭn, dra anŭn djă ba brơi kơ amĭ ñu. 
And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and came and brought word to Jesus. @ Ƀing ding kơna Yôhan rai mă drơi jan gơ̆ ba dơr hĭ, laih anŭn gơñu nao laĭ pơthâo tơlơi anŭn kơ Yêsu.
And Jesus, having heard it, went away thence by ship to a desert place apart. And the crowds having heard [of it] followed him on foot from the cities. @ Laih hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, Yêsu mơ̆ng anih anŭn đĭ sŏng nao pơ anih rơnguă Ñu dưi dŏ hơjăn.

And going out he saw a great crowd, and was moved with compassion about them, and healed their infirm. @ Tơdang Yêsu tơbiă đĭ nao pơ hang, Ñu ƀuh mơnuih lu lĭn. Ñu pap drap laih anŭn pơsuaih ƀing duăm ruă.
But when even was come, his disciples came to him saying, The place is desert, and [much of] the [day] time already gone by; dismiss the crowds, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves. @ Tơ adai klam laih, ƀing ding kơna nao pơ Ñu laih anŭn laĭ: “Anai jing anih rơnguă rơnguăn, adai mơmŏt laih.

But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give *ye* them to eat. @ Yêsu laĭ: “Ƀu kiăng ôh kơ gơñu khŏm nao; Ƀing gih yơh brơi kơ gơñu mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă.”
But they say to him, We have not here save five loaves and two fishes. @ Ƀing ding kơna laĭ glaĭ: “Pơ anai gơmơi hmâo kơnơ̆ng rơma klŏ ƀañ tơpŭng laih anŭn dua drơi akan đôč.”
And he said, Bring them here to me. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ba ƀañ tơpŭng hăng akan anŭn kơ Kâo.” 
And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed: and having broken the loaves, he gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds. @ Ñu pơtă kơ ƀing mơnuih lu anŭn dŏ ber ƀơi rơ̆k.

And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Ñu brơi ƀing ding kơna đĭ sŏng laih anŭn găn ia rơsĭ nao hlâo pơ hang gah dih, hlăk anŭn mơ̆n Ñu brơi ƀing mơnuih lu anŭn glaĭ. 
And having dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when even was come, he was alone there, @ Giơ̆ng kơ Ñu brơi ƀing mơnuih lu glaĭ, Ñu đĭ pơ čư̆ hơjăn Ñu kiăng kơ iâu laĭ. Tơ adai mơmŏt laih, Ñu ăt dŏ pơ anŭn hơjăn Ñu.

But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them, walking on the sea. @ Jĕ mơguah Yêsu rơbat ƀơi ngŏ jơlah ia nao pơ ƀing gơñu. 
And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear. @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing ding kơna ƀuh Ñu rơbat ƀơi ngŏ jơlah ia, gơñu hwĭ bral biă mă laih anŭn laĭ: “Atâo yơh anŭn!” Laih anŭn gơñu ur kraih hăng tơlơi hwĭ.

And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be *thou*, command me to come to thee upon the waters. @ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Ơ Khua, tơdah Ih sĭt, brơi kâo rơbat ƀơi hăng ngŏ jơlah ia nao pơ Ih.” 
And he said, Come. And Peter, having descended from the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus. @ Yêsu laĭ: “Rai bĕ!” Tui anŭn Pêtrôs tơbiă mơ̆ng sŏng hăng rơbat ƀơi ngŏ jơlah ia nao pơ Yêsu. 
But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me. @ Samơ̆ tơ ñu ƀuh angĭn kơtang, ñu hwĭ laih anŭn čơdơ̆ng trăm, tui anŭn Ñu ur: “Ơ Khua, pơklaih kâo.” 
And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt? @ Tañ mơtam Yêsu yơr tơngan mă ñu, laih anŭn laĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ mơnuih hmâo tơlơi đaŏ anĕt, yua hơgĕt ih đing?” 
And when they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell. @ Tơ gơñu đĭ amăng sŏng laih, angĭn hlŏng hơđơ̆ng mơtam. 
But those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God's Son. @ Ƀing dŏ amăng sŏng bon kơkuh kơ Ñu, hăng laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă, Ih jing Ană Ơi Adai.”
And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret. @ Tơ gơñu găn ia rơsĭ laih, gơñu đĭ pơ hang tring Gênêsaret. 
And when the men of that place recognised him, they sent to that whole country around, and they brought to him all that were ill, @ Mơnuih amăng tring anŭn thâo krăn Ñu, gơñu pơkiaŏ arăng nao laĭ pơthâo pơ abih tring laih anŭn ba nao abih bang ƀing duăm ruă pơ Ñu.

Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come up to Jesus, saying, @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing Pharisi wơ̆t hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt rai mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem nao pơ Yêsu laih anŭn laĭ, 
Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread. @ “Yua hơgĕt ƀing ding kơna Ih gao tơlơi phiăn ơi adon đưm? Ƀing gơñu ƀu rao ôh tơngan gơñu hlâo kơ gơñu ƀơ̆ng huă!”
But he answering said to them, Why do *ye* also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching? @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Bơ ƀing gih, yua hơgĕt ƀing gih ngă gao tơlơi Ơi Adai pơtă laih anŭn ngă tui tơlơi phiăn ƀing gih pô lĕ?

And having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them, Hear and understand: @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn Ñu iâu ƀing ană plei rai pơ Ñu laih anŭn laĭ kơ gơñu: “Hmư̆ bĕ, laih anŭn brơi ƀing gih thâo hluh:

Then his disciples, coming up, said to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, have been offended? @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn ƀing ding kơna rai laĭ kơ Ñu: “Ih thâo mơ̆ ƀing Pharisi hil tơ gơñu hmư̆ tơlơi ih laĭ anŭn?”

And Peter answering said to him, Expound to us this parable. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs laĭ kơ Ñu: “Pơblang brơi kơ gơmơi tơlơi bơhmutu anŭn.”
But he said, Are *ye* also still without intelligence? @ Yêsu laĭ: “Ƀing gih ăt ƀu thâo hluh ôh hă? 
Do ye not yet apprehend, that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly, and is cast forth into the draught? @ Ƀing gih ƀu thâo hluh ôh hă mơnơ̆ng hơgĕt mŭt amăng bah nao truh amăng hlŭng laih anŭn hlŏng tơbiă pơ gah rơngiao?

And Jesus, going forth from thence, went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon; @ Yêsu đuaĭ mơ̆ng anŭn nao pơ tring Tir hăng Sidôn. 
and lo, a Canaanitish woman, coming out from those borders, cried [to him] saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon. @ Anai nê sa čô đah kơmơi Kanaan mơ̆ng tring anŭn truh laih anŭn kơwưh rơkâo kraih, hăng laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, Ană Đawit, pap mơñai kơ kâo đa.

But he did not answer her a word.

But she came and did him homage, saying, Lord, help me. @ Samơ̆ gơ̆ rai čon tơŭt ƀơi anăp Ñu hăng laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, rơkâo Ih djru kâo đa.”
But he answering said, It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀu gal ôh mă ƀañ tơpŭng ƀing ană laih anŭn glŏm brơi kơ asâo.”
But she said, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters. @ Gơ̆ laĭ: “Sĭt yơh, Ơ Khua Yang, samơ̆ khul asâo ăt ƀơ̆ng mơ̆n djah lĕ mơ̆ng kơƀang khua ƀing gơ̆.”
Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith [is] great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from *that* hour. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Ơ đah kơmơi anŭn hơi, tơlơi đaŏ ih prŏng biă mă!

And Jesus, going away from thence, came towards the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and sat down there; @ Yêsu mơ̆ng anih anŭn, hlŏng găn hluai tui hang ia rơsĭ Galilê. Ñu đĭ pơ čư̆ laih anŭn dŏ ber ƀơi anŭn. 
and great crowds came to him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others, and they cast them at his feet, and he healed them: @ Ƀing mơnuih lu biă mă rai pơ Ñu ba nao ƀing jo tơkai, ƀing bum mơta, ƀing rơwen, ƀing kơmlô, lu ƀing duăm ruă pơkŏn.

But Jesus, having called his disciples to [him], said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way. @ Yêsu iâu ƀing ding kơna Ñu rai pơ Ñu laih anŭn laĭ: “Kâo hmâo tơlơi pap kơ ƀing mơnuih lu anai, yua kơ gơñu dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Kâo klâo hrơi laih, laih anŭn ƀu hmâo mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă ôh.

And Jesus said to them, See and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu “Răng bĕ kơ tơpơi ƀing Pharisi laih anŭn ƀing Sadusi.”
And they reasoned among themselves, saying, Because we have taken no bread. @ Gơñu črŏng sai tơdruă gơñu hăng laĭ: “Yua kơ ƀing ta ƀu djă ba ôh ƀañ tơpŭng.”

From that time Jesus began to shew to his disciples that he must go away to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised. @ Mơ̆ng hrơi anŭn Yêsu čơdơ̆ng bơrơđah kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu kơ tơlơi Ñu khŏm nao pơ plei Yêrusalem, laih anŭn khŏm tŭ lu tơlơi ruă tơnap mơ̆ng ƀing kŏng tha, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, laih anŭn ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt.

And Peter taking him to [him] began to rebuke him, saying, [God] be favourable to thee, Lord; this shall in no wise be unto thee. @ Pêtrôs ba Ñu pơ anih hơjăn, laih anŭn ƀuah kơ Ñu: “Ơ Khua Yang, rơkâo Ơi Adai khă tơlơi anŭn! Tơlơi anai ƀu či truh kơ Ih ôh.”
But turning round, he said to Peter, Get away behind me, Satan; thou art an offence to me, for thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu wir lăng laih anŭn laĭ kơ Pêtrôs: “Ơ Satan, đuaĭ bĕ mơ̆ng Kâo!

Then Jesus said to his disciples, If any one desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Tơdah hlơi pô kiăng đuaĭ tui Kâo, ñu khŏm hơngah hĭ tơlơi ñu pô kiăng, glăm kơyâo bơrơkal ñu pô, laih anŭn đuaĭ tui Kâo.

And after six days Jesus takes with [him] Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up into a high mountain apart. @ Năm hrơi tơdơi Yêsu jak ba hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu Pêtrôs, Yakơ, laih anŭn Yôhan adơi Yakơ, laih anŭn ba gơñu đĭ pơ čŏng čư̆.

And Peter answering said to Jesus, Lord, it is good we should be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles: for thee one, and for Moses one, and one for Elias. @ Tui anŭn Pêtrôs pơhiăp hăng Yêsu: “Ơ Khua Yang, hiam biă mă ƀing ta dŏ ƀơi anai, tơdah Ih kiăng kâo či pơdơ̆ng klâo boh sang khăn ƀơi anai, sa boh kơ Ih, sa boh kơ Môis, laih anŭn sa boh kơ Êli.”
While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying, *This* is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight: hear him. @ Tơdang Pêtrôs dŏ pơhiăp, plŭt hmâo kơthul kŏ kơmlă gom gơñu, laih anŭn hmâo asăp mơ̆ng kơthul laĭ: “Anai jing Ană Kâo khăp hơeng, amăng Ñu Kâo hmâo tơlơi mơak biă mă.

And the disciples hearing [it] fell upon their faces, and were greatly terrified. @ Tơ ƀing ding kơna hmư̆ tơlơi anai, gơñu rơbuh kŭp ƀô̆ ƀơi lŏn bă hăng tơlơi hwĭ biă mă. 
And Jesus coming to [them] touched them, and said, Rise up, and be not terrified. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu rai ruaih gơñu, laĭ: “Tơgŭ bĕ, anăm hwĭ ôh.” 
And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus alone. @ Laih anŭn tơ gơñu angak lăng, gơñu ƀuh kơnơ̆ng hơjăn Yêsu đôč.
And as they descended from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one, until the Son of man be risen up from among [the] dead. @ Tơdang gơñu trŭn mơ̆ng čư̆, Yêsu pơtă kơ gơñu: “Anăm ƀing gih ră ruai kơ arăng ôh tơlơi ƀing gih ƀuh anai tơl Ană Mơnuih hơdip glaĭ laih mơ̆ng ƀing djai.”
And [his] disciples demanded of him saying, Why then say the scribes that Elias must first have come? @ Ƀing ding kơna tơña kơ Ñu: “Tui anŭn, yua hơgĕt ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt laĭ Êli khŏm rai hlâo?”
And he answering said to them, Elias indeed comes first and will restore all things. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Êli khŏm rai laih anŭn pơkra abih bang tơlơi; 
But I say unto you that Elias has already come, and they have not known him, but have done unto him whatever they would. Thus also the Son of man is about to suffer from them. @ samơ̆ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih Êli hmâo rai laih, laih anŭn arăng ƀu thâo krăn gơ̆ ôh, samơ̆ gơñu ngă kơ gơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi gơñu kiăng.

Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the baptist. @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing ding kơna thâo hluh yơh Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn kơ ƀing gơñu djơ̆ kơ Yôhan Ƀatem.
And when they came to the crowd, a man came to him, falling on his knees before him, and saying, @ Tơ gơñu truh pơ ƀing mơnuih lu, hmâo sa čô đah rơkơi rai čon tơŭt ƀơi anăp Yêsu, hăng laĭ,

And I brought him to thy disciples, and they were not able to heal him. @ Kâo hmâo ba laih gơ̆ pơ ƀing ding kơna Ih, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu dưi pơsuaih gơ̆ ôh.”
And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to me. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ rơnŭk djuai mơnuih ƀu hmâo tơlơi đaŏ laih anŭn kơpĭl, hơdôm sui Kâo či dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing gih? Hơdôm sui Kâo či gir hăng ƀing gih?

And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon went out from him, and the boy was healed from that hour. @ Yêsu ƀuah pơpuh yang sat, laih anŭn yang sat tơbiă hĭ mơ̆ng čơđai anŭn, ƀơi mông anŭn mơtam, čơđai anŭn suaih hĭ yơh.

And he says to them, Because of your unbelief; for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [seed], ye shall say to this mountain, Be transported hence there, and it shall transport itself; and nothing shall be impossible to you. @ Yêsu laĭ gơñu: “Yua kơ tơlơi đaŏ ƀing gih anĕt.

And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of man is about to be delivered up into [the] hands of men, @ Tơdang gơñu pơƀŭt glaĭ amăng čar Galilê, Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu: “Arăng či jao Ană Mơnuih amăng tơngan mơnuih,

And when they came to Capernaum, those who received the didrachmas came to Peter and said, Does your teacher not pay the didrachmas? @ Tơ gơñu truh pơ plei Kapernum, ƀing ring jia sang kơkuh pơpŭ nao pơ Pêtrôs laih anŭn laĭ: “Nai ih hmâo duh jia mơ̆?” 
He says, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, What dost thou think, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive custom or tribute? from their own sons or from strangers? @ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Ơ, Ñu duh jia mơ̆n.” Tơ Pêtrôs glaĭ pơ sang laih, Yêsu pơhiăp hăng ñu hlâo, tơña: “Ơ Simôn, hyư̆m ih pơmĭn?

Peter says to him, From strangers. Jesus said to him, Then are the sons free. @ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Mơ̆ng ƀing pơkŏn.”
Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Tui anŭn yơh ƀing ană gơñu pô huaĭ duh jia ôh. 
But that we may not be an offence to them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up, and when thou hast opened its mouth thou wilt find a stater; take that and give it to them for me and thee. @ Samơ̆ kiăng kơ ƀing ta ƀu ngă brơi gơñu teč tơhnač ôh, nao bĕ pơ ia rơsĭ wah akan, mă akan djơ̆ wah blŭng hlâo.

In that hour the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens? @ Ƀơi mông anŭn ƀing ding kơna nao pơ Yêsu laih anŭn tơña: “Hlơi pô jing prŏng hloh amăng dêh čar pơtao plei hiam?”
And Jesus having called a little child to [him], set it in their midst, @ Yêsu iâu sa čô čơđai anĕt, pioh gơ̆ dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi tơ̆ng krah gơñu, laih anŭn laĭ, 
and said, Verily I say to you, Unless ye are converted and become as little children, ye will not at all enter into the kingdom of the heavens. @ “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơdah ƀing gih ƀu pơplih jing kar hăng čơđai anĕt, ƀing gih ƀu či dưi mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao plei hiam ôh. 
Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, *he* is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens; @ Hlơi pô luă gŭ ñu pô kar hăng sa čô čơđai anai, ñu jing pô prŏng hloh amăng dêh čar pơtao plei hiam. 
and whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name, receives me. @ Hlơi pô tŭ jum sa čô čơđai kar hăng anai amăng anăn Kâo jing ñu tŭ jum Kâo yơh;”
But whosoever shall offend one of these little ones who believe in me, it were profitable for him that a great millstone had been hanged upon his neck and he be sunk in the depths of the sea. @ “Tơdah hlơi pô ngă brơi sa čô amăng ƀing čơđai anĕt anai hmâo đaŏ laih kơ Kâo lĕ hĭ amăng tơlơi soh, hiam hloh brơi arăng akă sa boh rơsŭng boh pơtâo ƀơi tơkuai ñu laih anŭn glŏm hĭ amăng ia rơsĭ dlam. 
Woe to the world because of offences! For it must needs be that offences come; yet woe to that man by whom the offence comes! @ Răm ƀăm yơh kơ lŏn tơnah yua kơ hmâo lu tơlơi pơsoh. Yua kơ phiăn yơh khŏm hmâo tơlơi pơsoh, samơ̆ răm ƀăm yơh kơ hlơi pô brơi tơlơi pơsoh truh.
And if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut it off and cast [it] from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life lame or maimed, [rather] than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire. @ Tơdah tơngan ƀôdah tơkai ih pơsoh kơ ih ngă brơi ih lĕ amăng tơlơi soh, čơ̆ng glŏm hĭ ñu mơ̆ng ih; jing hiam hloh kơ ih mŭt amăng tơlơi hơdip hăng tơkai tơngan đŭt, kơ ih hmâo tum dua ƀĕ tơngan ƀôdah dua ƀĕ tơkai samơ̆ arăng glŏm hĭ amăng war apui ƀơ̆ng hlŏng lar. 
And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out and cast [it] from thee; it is good for thee to enter into life one-eyed, [rather] than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire. @ Laih anŭn tơdah mơta ih pơsoh kơ ih ngă brơi ih lĕ amăng tơlơi soh, blač glŏm hĭ ñu mơ̆ng ih; jing hiam hloh kơ ih mŭt amăng tơlơi hơdip hăng sa gah mơta kơ hmâo dua gah mơta samơ̆ arăng glŏm ih amăng war apui.”
See that ye do not despise one of these little ones; for I say unto you that their angels in [the] heavens continually behold the face of my Father who is in [the] heavens. @ “Răng bĕ, anăm lăng jrăp ôh kơ sa čô amăng ƀing čơđai anĕt anai; yua kơ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, amăng adai ƀing ling jang gơñu ƀuh nanao ƀô̆ mơta Ama Kâo, Pô dŏ amăng adai.
What think ye? If a certain man should have a hundred sheep, and one of them be gone astray, does he not, leaving the ninety and nine on the mountains, go and seek the one that has gone astray? @ Hyư̆m ƀing gih pơmĭn?

And if it should come to pass that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices more because of it than because of the ninety and nine not gone astray. @ Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơdah ñu ƀuh laih triu anŭn, ñu hơ̆k mơak kơ triu anŭn hloh kơ ƀing dua păn pluh dua rơpăn drơi ƀu čơlah ôh. 
So it is not the will of your Father who is in [the] heavens that one of these little ones should perish. @ Kar hăng tui anŭn mơ̆n Ama ƀing gih amăng adai ƀu kiăng ôh sa čô amăng ƀing čơđai anĕt anai răm rơngiă hĭ.”
But if thy brother sin against thee, go, reprove him between thee and him alone. If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. @ “Tơdah adơi ayŏng ih ngă soh hăng ih, nao bĕ pơ ñu laĭ brơi ñu thâo tơlơi anŭn kơnơ̆ng hơjăn ih hăng ñu đôč.

Verily I say to you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on the earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on the earth shall be loosed in heaven. @ “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih akă ƀơi lŏn tơnah arăng ăt či akă amăng adai mơ̆n; laih anŭn hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih kleh ƀơi lŏn tơnah arăng ăt či kleh amăng adai mơ̆n.
Again I say to you, that if two of you shall agree on the earth concerning any matter, whatsoever it may be that they shall ask, it shall come to them from my Father who is in [the] heavens. @ Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih dơ̆ng, tơdah dua čô amăng ƀing gih ƀơi lŏn tơnah sa pran jua rơkâo hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng ƀing gih kiăng, Ama Kâo amăng adai či ngă brơi kơ ƀing gih.

Then Peter came to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times? @ Hlăk anŭn Pêtrôs nao pơ Ñu hăng tơña: “Ơ Khua Yang, hơdôm wơ̆t kâo či pap brơi kơ adơi ayŏng kâo tơdah ñu ngă soh hăng kâo? Djơ̆ mơ̆ tơl tơjuh wơ̆t?”

For this cause the kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who would reckon with his bondmen. @ Hnŭn yơh, dêh čar pơtao plei hiam dưi pơhmô hăng sa čô pơtao kiăng tĭng hơnưh ƀing ding kơna ñu đom kơ ñu. 
And having begun to reckon, one debtor of ten thousand talents was brought to him. @ Tơ ñu čơdơ̆ng tĭng, arăng ba rai pơ ñu sa čô đom hơnưh sa rơbăn tơlăng. 
But he not having anything to pay, [his] lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and his children, and everything that he had, and that payment should be made. @ Samơ̆ yua kơ ding kơna anŭn ƀu dưi kla hơnưh ôh, khua gơ̆ pơtă brơi arăng sĭ hĭ gơ̆ wơ̆t ană bơnai gơ̆ laih anŭn abih bang mơnơ̆ng gơ̆ hmâo kiăng kla hơnưh. 
The bondman therefore falling down did him homage, saying, Lord, have patience with me and I will pay thee all. @ Ding kơna anŭn čon tơŭt kơwưh kơ ñu: ‘Ơ khua, añ dŏ tơguan brơi kâo đa, laih anŭn kâo či kla abih hơnưh ih.’

But that bondman having gone out, found one of his fellow-bondmen who owed him a hundred denarii.

But his fellow-bondmen, having seen what had taken place, were greatly grieved, and went and recounted to their lord all that had taken place. @ Tơ ƀing gơ̆p mă bruă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu ƀuh tui anŭn, gơñu rơngot biă mă, laih anŭn laĭ pơthâo kơ khua gơñu abih tơlơi hmâo truh laih. 
Then his lord, having called him to [him], says to him, Wicked bondman! I forgave thee all that debt because thou besoughtest me; @ Tui anŭn khua ñu iâu ñu hăng laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Ơ ding kơna sat ƀai, kâo pap brơi laih abih hơnưh ih yua kơ ih kơwưh rơkâo kơ kâo.

And his lord being angry delivered him to the tormentors till he paid all that was owing to him. @ Hăng tơlơi hil biă mă khua ñu jao ñu kơ ƀing wai mơnă tơl ñu kla abih hơnưh ñu.

And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these words, he withdrew from Galilee, and came to the coasts of Judaea beyond the Jordan; @ Tơ Yêsu pơhiăp giơ̆ng laih hơdôm tơlơi anai, Ñu đuaĭ mơ̆ng tring Galilê mŭt amăng tring Yuđa hang gah adih ia krong Yurdan.

so that they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. @ Hnŭn yơh gơñu ƀu jing dua dơ̆ng ôh, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng sa asar đeh đôč. Tui anŭn, anăm brơi mơnuih pơčơlah hĭ ôh hơgĕt tơlơi Ơi Adai hmâo pơgop laih.”
They say to him, Why then did Moses command to give a letter of divorce and to send [her] away? @ Ƀing Pharisi tơña kơ Ñu: “Tui anŭn yua hơgĕt Môis pơtă brơi ngă hră klaih bơnai, laih anŭn lui hĭ gơ̆?”
He says to them, Moses, in view of your hardheartedness, allowed you to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not thus. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Yua kơ pran jua ƀing gih khăng, tui anŭn Môis tŭ ư brơi ƀing gih lui bơnai ƀing gih, samơ̆ mơ̆ng phŭn ƀu djơ̆ tui anŭn ôh. 
But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, not for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery; and he who marries one put away commits adultery. @ Laih anŭn Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hlơi pô lui bơnai ñu tơdah ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ bơnai ñu klĕ pyu ôh laih anŭn dŏ đah kơmơi pơkŏn dơ̆ng, ñu anŭn klĕ pyu yơh.”
His disciples say to him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. @ Ƀing ding kơna laĭ hăng Ñu: “Tơdah sa čô đah rơkơi dưi lui bơnai ñu kơnơ̆ng yua kơ sa tơlơi tui anŭn đôč, hiam hloh ƀu dŏ bơnai ôh.”
And he said to them, All cannot receive this word, but those to whom it has been given; @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ ƀing gơ̆: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh abih bang mơnuih dưi tŭ mă boh pơhiăp anai, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng kơ ƀing mơnuih Ơi Adai pha brơi laih tơlơi anŭn. 
for there are eunuchs which have been born thus from [their] mother's womb; and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs of men; and there are eunuchs who have made eunuchs of themselves for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens. He that is able to receive [it], let him receive [it]. @ Yua kơ hmâo mơnuih jing kriao mơ̆ng hrơi arăng tơkeng kơ ñu, laih anŭn hmâo đơđa mơnuih jing kriao yua mơ̆ng tơngan mơnuih, laih anŭn hmâo đơđa ƀing kriao mă gơñu pô yua kơ dêh čar pơtao plei hiam. Hlơi pô dưi mă tŭ boh pơhiăp anai, brơi ñu mă tŭ bĕ.”
Then there were brought to him little children that he might lay his hands on them and pray; but the disciples rebuked them. @ Hlăk anŭn arăng ba rai ƀing čơđai pơ Ñu kiăng kơ Ñu ah tơngan ƀơi ƀing gơ̆ laih anŭn iâu laĭ. Samơ̆ ƀing ding kơna khă ƀing anŭn. 
But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and do not hinder them from coming to me; for the kingdom of the heavens is of such: @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ: “Brơi ƀing čơđai rai pơ Kâo, anăm khă gơñu ôh; yua kơ dêh čar pơtao plei hiam pioh kơ ƀing jing kar hăng gơñu.”
and having laid his hands upon them, he departed thence. @ Yêsu ah tơngan ƀơi ƀing čơđai, laih anŭn Ñu đuaĭ mơ̆ng anŭn.
And lo, one coming up said to him, Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have life eternal? @ Hlăk anŭn, hmâo sa čô mơnuih nao pơ Ñu, hăng tơña: “Ơ Nai, hơgĕt tơlơi hiam kâo khŏm ngă kiăng kơ dưi hmâo tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar?”
And he said to him, What askest thou me concerning goodness? one is good. But if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Yua hơgĕt ih tơña kơ Kâo hơgĕt jing hiam? Kơnơ̆ng hmâo Sa čô đôč jing hiam. Tơdah ih kiăng mŭt amăng tơlơi hơdip, brơi ih gưt tui tơlơi juăt.”
He says to him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, @ Gơ̆ tơña kơ Yêsu: “Hơgĕt tơlơi juăt anŭn?” Yêsu laĭ: “Anăm pơdjai mơnuih ôh; anăm klĕ pyu ôh; anăm klĕ dram gơnam arăng ôh; anăm pơčeh ƀlor ôh. 
Honour thy father and thy mother, and Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. @ Pơpŭ kơ amĭ ama ih, laih anŭn khăp kơ pô jum dar ih kar hăng kơ ih pô.”
The young man says to him, All these have I kept; what lack I yet? @ Pô tơdăm anŭn laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo tui gưt laih abih bang tơlơi juăt anŭn; hơgĕt tơlơi kâo dŏ kơƀah?”
Jesus said to him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell what thou hast and give to [the] poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Tơdah ih kiăng jing klă tum, nao bĕ, sĭ hĭ hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng ih hmâo laih anŭn pha brơi kơ ƀing ƀun rin, laih anŭn ih či hmâo kong ngăn yom amăng adai. Laih anŭn rai bĕ, đuaĭ tui Kâo.”
But the young man, having heard the word, went away grieved, for he had large possessions. @ Tơ pô tơdăm anŭn hmư̆ boh pơhiăp anŭn, ñu đuaĭ hĭ bă hăng tơlơi rơngot yua kơ ñu hmâo kong ngăn lu biă mă.
And Jesus said to his disciples, Verily I say unto you, A rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of the heavens; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơnap biă mă kơ sa čô pơdrŏng mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao plei hiam. 
and again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to enter a needle's eye than a rich man into the kingdom of God. @ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih dơ̆ng, sa drơi aseh samô mŭt bah amăng jrum amuñ hloh kơ sa čô pơdrŏng mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai.”
And when the disciples heard [it] they were exceedingly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? @ Tơ ƀing ding kơna hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơñu hling hlang biă mă hăng laĭ: “Tui anŭn hlơi dưi klaih lĕ?”
But Jesus, looking on [them], said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu lăng kơ ƀing gơñu hăng laĭ: “Tơlơi anŭn mơnuih ƀu dưi ngă ôh, samơ̆ Ơi Adai dưi ngă abih bang tơlơi.”
Then Peter answering said to him, Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee; what then shall happen to us? @ Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ kơ Ñu dơ̆ng: “Anai nê, gơmơi lui hĭ laih abih bang mơnơ̆ng hăng đuaĭ tui Ih. Tui anŭn hơgĕt gơmơi či hmâo lĕ?”
And Jesus said to them, Verily I say unto you, That *ye* who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit down upon his throne of glory, *ye* also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, amăng rơnŭk abih bang mơnơ̆ng plih phrâo či truh, tơ Ană Mơnuih či dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao guh kơang Ñu, ƀing gih jing ƀing hmâo đuaĭ tui Kâo laih, ăt kar kaĭ mơ̆n či dŏ ber ƀơi pluh dua boh gre pơtao kiăng phat kơđi pluh dua kơnŭng djuai ƀing Israel. 
And every one who has left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit life eternal. @ Laih anŭn rĭm čô hlơi pô lui hĭ sang ñu ƀôdah adơi ayŏng, amai adơi, amĭ ama, ƀing ană bă, ƀôdah lŏn hmua ñu yua kơ anăn Kâo, pô anŭn či mă tŭ sa rơtuh wơ̆t lu hloh dơ̆ng laih anŭn hmâo wơ̆t hăng tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar. 
But many first shall be last, and last first. @ Samơ̆ lu ƀing hlâo či jing tơdơi, laih anŭn ƀing tơdơi či jing hlâo.”
For the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who went out with the early morn to hire workmen for his vineyard. @ “Dêh čar pơtao adai jing kar hăng sa čô khua sang ưm mơguah tơbiă nao kiăng iâu apah mơnuih mă bruă amăng đang boh kơƀâu ñu. 
And having agreed with the workmen for a denarius the day, he sent them into his vineyard. @ Giơ̆ng hmâo tơlơi tŭ ư laih hăng ƀing mă bruă sa đơniê amăng sa hrơi, ñu pơkiaŏ nao gơñu pơ đang boh kơƀâu ñu. 
And having gone out about [the] third hour, he saw others standing in the market-place idle; @ Ƀơi kơplah dua rơpăn mông mơguah ñu tơbiă nao dơ̆ng laih anŭn ƀuh ƀing mơnuih dŏ đôč đač amăng anih sang sĭ mia. 
and to them he said, Go also ye into the vineyard, and whatsoever may be just I will give you. And they went their way. @ Ñu laĭ kơ ƀing anŭn: ‘Kar kaĭ mơ̆n ƀing gih nao bĕ mă bruă amăng đang boh kơƀâu kâo, laih anŭn kâo či apah ƀing gih djơ̆ nua.’ Tui anŭn gơñu nao mơtam yơh. 
Again, having gone out about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise. @ Ƀơi yang hrơi dơ̆ng, laih anŭn ƀơi klâo mông klam pô đang boh kơƀâu tơbiă nao dơ̆ng hăng ngă kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n. 
But about the eleventh [hour], having gone out, he found others standing, and says to them, Why stand ye here all the day idle? @ Ƀơi rơma mông klam ñu tơbiă nao dơ̆ng ƀuh ƀing pơkŏn dŏ đôč đač, laih anŭn ñu laĭ kơ ƀing gơ̆: ‘Yua hơgĕt ƀing gih dŏ pơ anai đôč đač abih sa hrơi?’ 
They say to him, Because no man has hired us. He says to them, Go also ye into the vineyard [and whatsoever may be just ye shall receive]. @ Ƀing anŭn laĭ hăng ñu: ‘Yua kơ ƀu hmâo hlơi kiăng yua gơmơi ôh.’ Pô đang laĭ kơ ƀing gơ̆: ‘Ƀing gih kar kaĭ mơ̆n nao bĕ mă bruă amăng đang boh kơƀâu kâo.’
But when the evening was come, the lord of the vineyard says to his steward, Call the workmen and pay [them] their wages, beginning from the last even to the first. @ Tơ adai klam laih, pô đang boh kơƀâu laĭ kơ pô wai bruă ñu: ‘Iâu bĕ ƀing mă bruă laih anŭn brơi prăk kơ ƀing gơñu čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng ƀing tơdơi truh kơ ƀing blŭng hlâo.’ 
And when they [who came to work] about the eleventh hour came, they received each a denarius. @ Ƀing mơnuih mă bruă čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng rơma mông klam rai, rĭm čô gơñu mă prăk apah sa đơniê. 
And when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more, and they received also themselves each a denarius. @ Tơ ƀing mơnuih mă bruă čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng blŭng hlâo rai, gơñu pơmĭn dah či mă tŭ lu hloh. Samơ̆ rĭm čô gơñu ăt mă tŭ sa đơniê kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
And on receiving it they murmured against the master of the house, @ Laih anŭn tơ gơñu mă tŭ sa đơniê anŭn gơñu pơhiăp brŏk kơ pô đang, 
saying, These last have worked one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden of the day and the heat. @ hăng laĭ: ‘Ƀing rai tơdơi mă bruă kơnơ̆ng sa mông đôč, laih anŭn ih yap gơñu mơdơ̆ hăng gơmơi jing ƀing mă bruă gleh kơtraŏ hăng dang gah yŭ pơ-iă kơtang abih sa hrơi.’ 
But he answering said to one of them, [My] friend, I do not wrong thee. Didst thou not agree with me for a denarius? @ Samơ̆ pô đang laĭ glaĭ kơ sa čô amăng ƀing gơñu: ‘Ơ gơyut, kâo ƀu soh hăng ih ôh; ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă ih tŭ ư laih hăng kâo sa hrơi mă bruă kơnơ̆ng sa đơniê đôč? 
Take what is thine and go. But it is my will to give to this last even as to thee: @ Mă bĕ prăk ih laih anŭn nao bĕ; kâo kiăng brơi kơ pô rai tơdơi anai mơdôm hăng ih. 
is it not lawful for me to do what I will in my own affairs? Is thine eye evil because *I* am good? @ Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă kâo dưi yua gơnam kâo tui hăng kâo kiăng? Ƀôdah yua kơ ih ƀuh kâo čơmah, hnŭn yơh ih moañ?’
Thus shall the last be first, and the first last; for many are called ones, but few chosen ones. @ Tui anŭn ƀing tơdơi či jing hlâo, laih anŭn ƀing hlâo či jing tơdơi.”
And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples with [him] apart in the way, and said to them, @ Tơdang Yêsu đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem, Ñu ba hơjăn ƀing pluh dua čô ding kơna, laih anŭn rŏk jơlan Ñu laĭ kơ gơñu, 
Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be delivered up to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death; @ “Anai nê, ƀing ta nao pơ plei Yêrusalem; arăng či jao Ană Mơnuih kơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laih anŭn ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt, laih anŭn ƀing gơñu či klă kơđi pơdjai hĭ Ñu. 
and they will deliver him up to the nations to mock and to scourge and to crucify, and the third day he shall rise again. @ Gơñu či jao Ñu kơ ƀing djuai tuai kiăng kơ arăng klao mưč, taih Ñu hăng gai hnuăt, laih anŭn pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal; samơ̆ ƀơi hrơi tal klâo Ñu či hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng.”
Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee, with her sons, doing homage, and asking something of him. @ Hlăk anŭn amĭ ƀing ană đah rơkơi Sêbêdê nao pơ Yêsu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ană đah rơkơi gơ̆. Đah kơmơi anŭn čon tơŭt ƀơi anăp Yêsu kiăng rơkâo sa tơlơi.
And he said to her, What wilt thou? She says to him, Speak [the word] that these my two sons may sit, one on thy right hand and one on thy left in thy kingdom. @ Yêsu tơña kơ ñu: “Hơgĕt ih kiăng?” Đah kơmơi laĭ hăng Ñu: “Brơi dua čô ană đah rơkơi kâo dưi dŏ ber sa čô gah hơnuă, sa čô gah iao Ih amăng dêh čar pơtao Ih.”
And Jesus answering said, Ye know not what ye ask. Can ye drink the cup which *I* am about to drink? They say to him, We are able. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih ƀu thâo hluh ôh hơgĕt ƀing gih rơkâo. Dưi mơ̆ ƀing gih mơñum kơčok Kâo či mơñum?” Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Gơmơi dưi mơ̆n.”
[And] he says to them, Ye shall drink indeed my cup, but to sit on my right hand and on [my] left, is not mine to give, but to those for whom it is prepared of my Father. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih či mơñum kơčok Kâo, samơ̆ tơlơi dưi dŏ ber gah hơnuă ƀôdah gah iao Kâo, Kâo ƀu hmâo ôh tơlơi dưi brơi tơlơi anŭn, samơ̆ tơlơi anŭn pioh kơ ƀing hlơi Ama Kâo hmâo prăp pre brơi laih.”
And the ten, having heard [of it], were indignant about the two brothers. @ Tơ ƀing pluh čô ding kơna pơkŏn hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơñu hil kơ dua čô adơi ayŏng anŭn. 
But Jesus having called them to [him], said, Ye know that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over them, and the great exercise authority over them. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu iâu gơñu hăng laĭ: “Ƀing gih thâo laih ƀing arăng brơi wai lăng ƀing djuai tuai khăp yua tơlơi kơtư̆ juă wai lăng ană plei, laih anŭn ƀing khua prŏng gơñu khăp yua tơlơi dưi kơtang amăng tơlơi gĭt gai ană plei pla.

And as they went out from Jericho a great crowd followed him. @ Tơdang gơñu tơbiă mơ̆ng plei Yêrikô, hmâo lu mơnuih đuaĭ tui Yêsu. 
And lo, two blind men, sitting by the wayside, having heard that Jesus was passing by, cried out saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David. @ Anai nê, hmâo dua čô bum mơta dŏ ƀơi akiăng jơlan. Tơ gơñu hmư̆ kơ Yêsu găn pơ anŭn, gơñu ur kraih: “Ơ Khua Yang, Ană pơtao Đawit, pap mơñai kơ gơmơi đa!”
But the crowd rebuked them, that they might be silent. But they cried out the more, saying, Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David. @ Ƀing mơnuih lu khă brơi gơñu dŏ rơiăt; samơ̆ gơñu ur kraih kơtang hloh dơ̆ng: “Ơ Khua Yang, Ană pơtao Đawit, pap mơñai kơ gơmơi đa!”
And Jesus, having stopped, called them and said, What will ye that I shall do to you? @ Yêsu dŏ hĭ, iâu gơñu laih anŭn laĭ: “Hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih kiăng Kâo ngă brơi kơ ƀing gih?”
They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened. @ Gơñu laĭ hăng Yêsu: “Ơ Khua Yang, brơi mơta gơmơi dưi ƀuh rơđah.”
And Jesus, moved with compassion, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes had sight restored to them, and they followed him. @ Hăng tơlơi pap Yêsu ruaih mơta gơñu, tui anŭn mơta gơñu ƀuh rơđah mơtam, laih anŭn gơñu đuaĭ tui Yêsu.
And when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, at the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, @ Tơdang Yêsu hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu giăm truh pơ Plei Yêrusalem, truh pơ plei Bêtphajê ƀơi čư̆ Ôliwơ, Yêsu pơkiaŏ nao dua čô ƀing ding kơna, 
saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and immediately ye will find an ass tied, and a colt with it; loose [them] and lead [them] to me. @ laĭ kơ gơñu tui anai: “Nao bĕ pơ plei ƀơi anăp ƀing gih, pơ anŭn ƀing gih či ƀuh arăng akă sa drơi aseh kle ania, ƀơi anŭn hmâo wơ̆t ană ñu.

But all this came to pass, that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying, @ Tơlơi anai truh kiăng pơsĭt tơlơi pô laĭ lui hlâo pơhiăp laih tui anai:
Say to the daughter of Zion, Behold thy King cometh to thee, meek, and mounted upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. @ “Laĭ bĕ kơ ană dra Siôn thâo:

But the disciples, having gone and done as Jesus had ordered them, @ Ƀing ding kơna nao laih anŭn ngă tui kar hăng tơlơi Yêsu hmâo pơtă laih kơ gơñu. 
brought the ass and the colt and put their garments upon them, and he sat on them. @ Gơñu dui ba aseh kle ania laih anŭn ană ñu, gơñu tap ao ƀơi rŏng dua drơi aseh anŭn, laih anŭn Yêsu đĭ. 
But a very great crowd strewed their own garments on the way, and others kept cutting down branches from the trees and strewing them on the way. @ Ƀing mơnuih lu biă mă tap ao gơñu ƀơi jơlan, ƀing pơkŏn dơ̆ng koh than kơyâo laih anŭn tap ƀơi jơlan. 
And the crowds who went before him and who followed cried, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; blessed [be] he who comes in the name of [the] Lord; hosanna in the highest. @ Ƀing mơnuih lu rơbat ƀơi anăp laih anŭn đuaĭ tui klon Yêsu ur kraih: “Hôsana kơ Ană Đawit!

And the crowds said, This is Jesus the prophet who is from Nazareth of Galilee. @ Ƀing mơnuih lu laĭ glaĭ: “Pô anai jing Yêsu, pô laĭ lui hlâo mơ̆ng plei Nasaret čar Galilê.”
And Jesus entered into the temple [of God], and cast out all that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those that sold the doves. @ Yêsu mŭt amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ Ơi Adai laih anŭn puh pơđuaĭ ƀing dŏ sĭ mia wơ̆t blơi mơnơ̆ng amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ.

And when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders which he wrought, and the children crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were indignant, @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laih anŭn ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt ƀuh khul tơlơi yom pơphan Yêsu ngă, laih anŭn hmư̆ ƀing čơđai ur kraih amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ: “Hôsana kơ Ană Đawit” gơñu hil biă mă. 
and said to him, Hearest thou what these say?

And Jesus answering said to them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and do not doubt, not only shall ye do what [is done] to the fig-tree, but even if ye should say to this mountain, Be thou taken away and be thou cast into the sea, it shall come to pass. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơdah ƀing gih hmâo tơlơi đaŏ laih anŭn ƀu đing ôh, ƀu djơ̆ ôh kơnơ̆ng ƀing gih dưi ngă tui anŭn kơ phŭn hra, samơ̆ tơdah ƀing gih laĭ kơ čư̆ anai: ‘Đuaĭ bĕ laih anŭn kơdâo amăng ia rơsĭ,’ wơ̆t tơlơi anŭn ăt či truh mơ̆n.

And when he came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him [as he was] teaching, saying, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? @ Yêsu mŭt amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laih anŭn ƀing kŏng tha ană plei pla rai laĭ kơ Ñu tơdang Ñu dŏ pơtô: “Mơ̆ng tơlơi dưi pă Ih ngă tơlơi anai?

And Jesus answering said to them, *I* also will ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, *I* also will tell you by what authority I do these things: @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Kâo ăt kiăng tơña kơ ƀing gih sa tơlơi mơ̆n, tơdah ƀing gih dưi laĭ glaĭ kơ Kâo, tui anŭn Kâo či laĭ glaĭ kơ ƀing gih mơ̆ng pă tơlơi dưi Kâo ngă hơdôm tơlơi anai. 
The baptism of John, whence was it? of heaven or of men?

But what think ye? A man had two children, and coming to the first he said, Child, go to-day, work in [my] vineyard. @ “Hơgĕt ƀing gih pơmĭn lĕ? Sa čô mơnuih hmâo dua čô ană đah rơkơi. Ñu nao laĭ kơ ană tal sa: ‘Ơ dăm, hrơi anai ih nao mă bruă amăng đang boh kơƀâu hŏ.’

Which of the two did the will of the father? They say [to him], The first. Jesus says to them, Verily I say unto you that the tax-gatherers and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. @ Hlơi amăng dua čô anŭn ngă tui hăng tơlơi ama ñu kiăng?” Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Pô ană tal sa anŭn.” Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, ƀing ring jia hăng ƀing đah kơmơi rih răm mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai hlâo kơ ƀing gih. 
For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the tax-gatherers and the harlots believed him; but *ye* when ye saw [it] repented not yourselves afterwards to believe him. @ Yua kơ Yôhan rai laih pơ ƀing gih amăng jơlan tơlơi tơpă, laih anŭn ƀing gih ƀu đaŏ kơ ñu ôh, samơ̆ ƀing ring jia laih anŭn ƀing đah kơmơi rih răm đaŏ kơ ñu, laih anŭn wơ̆t kơ laih ƀing gih ƀuh laih tơlơi anŭn, ƀing gih ăt ƀu kơhmal tơlơi soh laih anŭn đaŏ kơ ñu lơi.”
Hear another parable: There was a householder who planted a vineyard, and made a fence round it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and left the country. @ “Hmư̆ bĕ tơlơi bơhmutu pơkŏn. Hmâo sa čô pô lŏn pla sa blah đang boh kơƀâu. Ñu bư̆ rơgong jum dar, klơi sa bĭt luh djet tơpai, laih anŭn pơdơ̆ng đĭ sa boh sang rơñan kiăng kơ gak wai. Ñu brơi arăng čan đang boh kơƀâu anŭn, laih anŭn ñu nao čar pơkŏn. 
But when the time of fruit drew near, he sent his bondmen to the husbandmen to receive his fruits. @ Tơ truh bơyan pĕ boh, ñu pơkiaŏ nao ƀing ding kơna ñu nao pơ ƀing čan, kiăng mă kơmlai boh kơƀâu ñu. 
And the husbandmen took his bondmen, and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. @ Ƀing čan anŭn mă ƀing ding kơna ñu laih anŭn taih pô anai, pơdjai pô dih, laih anŭn glŏm boh pơtâo pô pơkŏn. 
Again he sent other bondmen more than the first, and they did to them in like manner. @ Ñu pơkiaŏ nao ƀing ding kơna pơkŏn lu hloh ƀing hlâo dơ̆ng. Laih anŭn ƀing čan anŭn ăt ngă kơ ƀing gơ̆ kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
And at last he sent to them his son, saying, They will have respect for my son. @ Hnal tuč ñu pơkiaŏ nao ană đah rơkơi ñu pô pơ ƀing anŭn, hăng laĭ: ‘Gơñu či pơpŭ ană đah rơkơi kâo.’ 
But the husbandmen, seeing the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him and possess his inheritance. @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing čan ƀuh ană đah rơkơi ñu, ƀing anŭn bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu: ‘Anai yơh jing pô tŭ mă kong ngăn; bơ bĕ brơi ƀing ta pơdjai hĭ ñu laih anŭn ƀing ta mă tŭ kong ngăn ñu.’ 
And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. @ Tui anŭn gơñu mă gơ̆, glŏm hĭ gơ̆ pơ gah rơngiao đang boh kơƀâu hăng pơdjai hĭ gơ̆.
When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what shall he do to those husbandmen? @ Tui anŭn, tơ pô đang boh kơƀâu anŭn truh, hơgĕt ñu či ngă kơ ƀing čan anŭn?”
They say to him, He will miserably destroy those evil [men], and let out the vineyard to other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons. @ Gơñu laĭ glaĭ kơ Yêsu: “Ñu či pơrai hĭ ƀing sat ƀai anŭn hăng tơlơi pơdjai tơnap tap, laih anŭn brơi ƀing pơkŏn čan đang boh kơƀâu ñu, jing ƀing či brơi kơmlai kơ ñu djơ̆ bơyan.”
Jesus says to them, Have ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which they that builded rejected, this has become the corner-stone: this is of [the] Lord, and it is wonderful in our eyes? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih aka lăng ôh hă Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih tui anai:

Therefore I say to you, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it. @ Yua kơ anŭn Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, arăng či mă hĭ dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai mơ̆ng ƀing gih laih anŭn brơi kơ sa kơnŭng djuai či hmâo boh than kơ dêh čar pơtao anŭn.

And the chief priests and the Pharisees, having heard his parables, knew that he spoke about them. @ Tơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laih anŭn ƀing Pharisi hmư̆ tơlơi bơhmutu Yêsu pơhiăp anŭn, gơñu thâo hluh Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn djơ̆ kơ ƀing gơñu. 
And seeking to lay hold of him, they were afraid of the crowds, because they held him for a prophet. @ Gơñu hơduah jơlan kiăng mă čaŏ Yêsu, samơ̆ gơñu hwĭ kơ ƀing mơnuih lu, yua kơ ƀing gơ̆ đaŏ kơ Yêsu jing sa čô Pô laĭ lui hlâo.
And Jesus answering spoke to them again in parables, saying, @ Yêsu yua tơlơi bơhmutu pơhiăp dơ̆ng hăng gơñu tui anai, 
The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who made a wedding feast for his son, @ “Dêh čar pơtao adai jing kar hăng sa čô pơtao pơkra tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă pơdŏ rơkơi bơnai kơ ană đah rơkơi ñu. 
and sent his bondmen to call the persons invited to the wedding feast, and they would not come. @ Ñu pơkiaŏ ƀing ding kơna ñu nao iâu ƀing ñu hmâo jak laih kơ tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă, samơ̆ ƀing anŭn ƀu kiăng rai ôh.

But they made light of it, and went, one to his own land, and another to his commerce. @ Samơ̆ ƀing gơñu jak anŭn ƀu bơngơ̆t ôh laih anŭn nao kơ bruă pơkŏn, pô anai nao pơ hmua, pô pơkŏn nao sĭ mia,

Then he says to his bondmen, The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy; @ Laih anŭn ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna ñu: ‘Mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă pơdŏ rơkơi bơnai pơkra giơ̆ng laih, samơ̆ ƀing kâo jak ƀu hmâo hlơi năng lăp rai ôh.

And those bondmen went out into the highways, and brought together all as many as they found, both evil and good; and the wedding feast was furnished with guests. @ Ƀing ding kơna anŭn nao pơ abih bang jơlan, jak ba abih bang ƀing mơnuih gơñu ƀuh, wơ̆t mơnuih sat wơ̆t mơnuih hiam.

And the king, having gone in to see the guests, beheld there a man not clothed with a wedding garment. @ Samơ̆ tơ pơtao mŭt lăng ƀing rai, pơ anŭn ñu ƀuh sa čô đah rơkơi ƀu buh ao phiăn ƀơ̆ng huă kơ tơlơi dŏ rơkơi bơnai ôh.

For many are called ones, but few chosen ones. @ Yua kơ arăng jak iâu lu mơnuih, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng ƀiă mơnuih đôč arăng ruah mă.”

And they send out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one, for thou regardest not men's person; @ Tui anŭn gơñu pơkiaŏ nao ƀing ding kơna gơñu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing mơnuih gah kơ Hêrôt, hăng laĭ: “Ơ Nai, gơmơi thâo Ih jing mơnuih tơpă sĭt, pơtô tơlơi Ơi Adai hăng tơlơi tơpă sĭt laih anŭn ih ƀu pơkah lăng mơnuih phara phara ôh; yua kơ Ih ƀu lăng ôh hyư̆m tơlơi arăng jing gah rơngiao.

And he says to them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? @ Yêsu tơña gơñu “Rup hăng anăn hlơi anai?” 
They say to him, Caesar's. Then he says to them, Pay then what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God. @ Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Pơtao Sêsar.” Tui anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Tui anŭn pơglaĭ bĕ kơ Sêsar gơnam lơ̆m kơ Sêsar, laih anŭn pơglaĭ bĕ kơ Ơi Adai hơgĕt gơnam lơ̆m kơ Ơi Adai.”

On that day came to him Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they demanded of him, @ Amăng hrơi anŭn mơ̆n, hmâo ƀing Sadusi rai pơ Yêsu, jing ƀing laĭ ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng ôh. Gơñu tơña kơ Yêsu tui anai,

Blessed is that bondman whom his lord on coming shall find doing thus. @ Mơyun hiam yơh kơ ding kơna anŭn, tơ khua ñu truh laih anŭn ƀuh ñu dŏ ngă tui anŭn!

But if that evil bondman should say in his heart, My lord delays to come, @ Samơ̆ tơdah ding kơna sat anŭn pơmĭn amăng pran jua ñu tui anai: ‘Khua kâo či truh kaih,’ 
and begin to beat his fellow-bondmen, and eat and drink with the drunken; @ ñu čơdơ̆ng taih tơdruă ƀing ding kơna gơ̆p mă bruă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu, laih anŭn ƀơ̆ng mơñum hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing măt tơpai, 
the lord of that bondman shall come in a day when he does not expect it, and in an hour he knows not of, @ khua ding kơna anŭn či truh amăng hrơi ñu ƀu ăng rơmăng, laih anŭn amăng mông ñu ƀu thâo ôh,

Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be made like to ten virgins that having taken their torches, went forth to meet the bridegroom. @ “Hlăk anŭn dêh čar pơtao plei hiam či jing kar hăng ƀing pluh čô dra hmŭm djă apui kơđen nao čơkă han tao. 
And five of them were prudent and five foolish. @ Amăng ƀing gơñu anŭn hmâo rơma čô mlŭk laih anŭn rơma čô kơhnâo. 
They that were foolish took their torches and did not take oil with them; @ Ƀing mlŭk djă apui kơđen, gơñu ƀu djă ba ia jâu hrŏm hơbĭt ôh. 
but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their torches. @ Samơ̆ ƀing kơhnâo djă apui kơđen laih anŭn djă wơ̆t get bă ia jâu. 
Now the bridegroom tarrying, they all grew heavy and slept. @ Yua kơ han tao kaih rai, abih bang gơñu leng rơbưi hăng pĭt hĭ yơh.
But in [the] middle of [the] night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom; go forth to meet him. @ Samơ̆ ƀơi tơ̆ng krah mlam hmâo asăp ur laĭ: ‘Adi dih, han tao rai yơh! Nao čơkă ñu bĕ!’ 
Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their torches. @ Tui anŭn abih bang ƀing dra hmŭm mơdưh tơgŭ laih anŭn prăp rơmet apui kơđen gơñu. 
And the foolish said to the prudent, Give us of your oil, for our torches are going out. @ Ƀing mlŭk laĭ kơ ƀing kơhnâo: ‘Rơkâo ƀing gih pha ƀiă ia jâu kơ gơmơi đa, yua kơ apui kơđen gơmơi giăm či djai yơh.’ 
But the prudent answered saying, [We cannot,] lest it might not suffice for us and for you. Go rather to those that sell, and buy for yourselves. @ Samơ̆ ƀing kơhnâo laĭ glaĭ: ‘Ƀu dưi ôh, hwĭ kơ ƀu djŏp kơ ƀing gơmơi wơ̆t kơ ƀing gih mơ̆n; hiam hloh nao bĕ pơ ƀing sĭ ia jâu laih anŭn blơi mă kơ gih pô.’ 
But as they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and the [ones that were] ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. @ Samơ̆ tơdang gơñu nao blơi, han tao truh yơh.

Afterwards come also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; @ Tơdơi ƀiă kơ anŭn ƀing dra hmŭm ăt truh mơ̆n laih anŭn laĭ: ‘Ơ khua, Ơ khua, pŏk brơi bah amăng kơ gơmơi đa.’

Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour. @ Tui anŭn, dŏ mơdưh bĕ, yua kơ ƀing gih ƀu thâo ôh hrơi, kŏn thâo mông lơi.”
For [it is] as [if] a man going away out of a country called his own bondmen and delivered to them his substance. @  “Dêh čar pơtao plei hiam jing kar hăng sa čô mơnuih či đuaĭ hyu pơ čar ataih, iâu ƀing ding kơna ñu hăng jao brơi kong ngăn ñu kơ ƀing gơ̆. 
And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to each according to his particular ability, and immediately went away out of the country. @ Kơ pô anai ñu brơi rơma tơlăng, kơ pô anŭn dua tơlăng, laih anŭn kơ pô pơkŏn sa tơlăng. Ñu brơi tui hăng tơlơi dưi ngă kơ rĭm čô. Laih anŭn ñu nao yơh. 
And he that had received the five talents went and trafficked with them, and made five other talents. @ Pô hmâo mă tŭ laih rơma tơlăng nao sĭ mia mơtam hăng tơlăng anŭn; laih anŭn ñu ƀơ̆ng kơmlai rơma tơlăng dơ̆ng. 
In like manner also he that [had received] the two, [he also] gained two others. @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n pô hmâo mă tŭ laih dua tơlăng, ƀơ̆ng kơmlai dua tơlăng dơ̆ng. 
But he that had received the one went and dug in the earth, and hid the money of his lord. @ Samơ̆ pô hmâo mă tŭ laih sa tơlăng nao klơi lŏn hăng dơr pơdŏp hĭ prăk khua ñu.
And after a long time the lord of those bondmen comes and reckons with them. @ Sui hrơi mơ̆ng anŭn, khua kơ ƀing ding kơna anŭn wơ̆t glaĭ hăng yap hră prăk hăng ƀing gơñu. 
And he that had received the five talents came to [him] and brought five other talents, saying, [My] lord, thou deliveredst me five talents; behold, I have gained five other talents besides them. @ Pô mă tŭ rơma tơlăng rai ba rơma tơlăng pơkŏn dơ̆ng hăng laĭ: ‘Ơ Khua, ih jao laih kơ kâo rơma tơlăng. Anai nê, kâo hmâo kơmlai rơma tơlăng pơkŏn dơ̆ng.’ 
His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter into the joy of thy lord. @ Khua ñu laĭ hăng ñu: ‘Hiam biă mă yơh, Ơ ding kơna tơpă hiam hăng tŏng ten ah.

And he also that had received the two talents came to [him] and said, [My] lord, thou deliveredst me two talents; behold, I have gained two other talents besides them. @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n pô mă tŭ dua tơlăng rai hăng laĭ: ‘Ơ Khua ih jao laih kơ kâo dua tơlăng.

His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful bondman, thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. @ Khua ñu laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Hiam biă mă yơh, Ơ ding kơna tơpă hiam hăng tŏng ten ah.

And he also that had received the one talent coming to [him] said, [My] lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hadst not sowed, and gathering from where thou hadst not scattered, @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn pô hmâo mă tŭ laih sa tơlăng rai hăng laĭ: ‘Ơ Khua, kâo thâo kơ ih jing sa čô mơnuih khăng khĭp.

and being afraid I went away and hid thy talent in the earth; behold, thou hast that which is thine. @ Tui anŭn yơh kâo hwĭ, laih anŭn kâo pơdŏp hĭ tơlăng ih amăng lŏn. Hĕ anai, mă bĕ gơnam ih pô.’ 
And his lord answering said to him, Wicked and slothful bondman, thou knewest that I reap where I had not sowed, and gather from where I had not scattered; @ Samơ̆ khua ñu laĭ glaĭ: ‘Ơ ding kơna sat ƀai laih anŭn alah!

thou oughtest then to have put my money to the money-changers, and when I came I should have got what is mine with interest. @ Tui anŭn, djơ̆ biă mă ih khŏm jao prăk kâo kơ ƀing sĭ mia prăk, laih anŭn ƀơi hrơi kâo wơ̆t glaĭ kâo dưi mă glaĭ prăk kâo wơ̆t hăng kơmlai ñu mơ̆n. 
Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that has the ten talents: @ Hnŭn yơh, mă hĭ bĕ prăk ñu hăng brơi kơ pô hmâo pluh tơlăng. 
for to every one that has shall be given, and he shall be in abundance; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him. @ Yua kơ arăng či thim brơi kơ hlơi pô hmâo laih, laih anŭn ñu či hmâo rơbeh blai; samơ̆ kơ hlơi pô ƀu hmâo ôh, arăng či mă hĭ wơ̆t mơnơ̆ng ñu hmâo laih mơ̆n. 
And cast out the useless bondman into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth. @ Bơ kơ ding kơna ƀu tŭ yua anai, glŏm hĭ bĕ ñu amăng anih kơnăm mơmŏt pơ gah rơngiao; ƀơi anŭn či hmâo tơlơi čŏk hia hăng tơlơi kĕ tơgơi.’”
But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit down upon his throne of glory, @ “Tơ Ană Mơnuih rai amăng tơlơi guh kơang Ñu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng abih bang ƀing ling jang, hlăk anŭn ñu či dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao ang yang Ñu. 
and all the nations shall be gathered before him; and he shall separate them from one another, as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; @ Abih bang djuai mơnuih či pơƀŭt glaĭ ƀơi anăp Ñu, laih anŭn Ñu či pơkah hĭ gơñu jing dua phung kar hăng pô wai triu pơkah hĭ triu mơ̆ng bơbe. 
and he will set the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on [his] left. @ Laih anŭn Ñu či pioh triu gah hơnuă Ñu, laih anŭn bơbe gah iao. 
Then shall the King say to those on his right hand, Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from [the] world's foundation: @ Hlăk anŭn Pơtao či laĭ kơ ƀing gah hơnuă ñu: ‘Rai bĕ, Ơ ƀing mơnuih Ama Kâo hmâo hơơč mơyun laih, mă tŭ bĕ dêh čar pơtao Ñu hmâo prăp pre brơi laih kơ ƀing gih mơ̆ng phŭn pơjing lŏn tơnah.

Then shall the righteous answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, and nourished thee; or thirsting, and gave thee to drink? @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing mơnuih tơpă či laĭ glaĭ kơ Ñu: ‘Ơ Khua Yang, hơbin pă gơmơi hmâo ƀuh Ih rơpa laih anŭn brơi kơ Ih mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă, ƀôdah Ih mơhao laih anŭn brơi kơ Ih ia mơñum?

And the King answering shall say to them, Verily, I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me. @ Laih anŭn Pơtao či laĭ glaĭ kơ ƀing gơñu: ‘Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơ ƀing gih ngă tơlơi anŭn kơ sa čô amăng ƀing adơi ayŏng Kâo anĕt aneo anai jing tơlơi ƀing gih hmâo ngă laih tơlơi anŭn kơ Kâo.’
Then shall he say also to those on the left, Go from me, cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: @ Hlăk anŭn Ñu či laĭ kơ ƀing dŏ gah iao Ñu: ‘Ơ ƀing hơtơ̆m pah laih đuaĭ bĕ mơ̆ng Kâo, nao mŭt amăng apui ƀơ̆ng hlŏng lar pơkra brơi laih kơ yang sat laih anŭn kơ ƀing ling jang sat ñu.

Then shall *they* also answer saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, or thirsting, or a stranger, or naked, or ill, or in prison, and have not ministered to thee? @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing anai či laĭ glaĭ kơ Ñu: ‘Ơ Khua Yang, hơbin pă gơmơi ƀuh Ih rơpa, mơhao, jing tuai, dŏ mơhlŭn, duăm ruă, ƀôdah arăng krư̆ laih anŭn gơmơi ƀu djru Ih ôh?’ 
Then shall he answer them saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have not done it to one of these least, neither have ye done it to me. @ Ñu či laĭ glaĭ kơ ƀing anŭn: ‘Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơdah ƀing gih ƀu ngă ôh tơlơi anŭn kơ sa čô amăng ƀing anĕt aneo anai, jing kar hăng ƀing gih ƀu hmâo ngă kơ Kâo ôh.’

And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, @ Tơ Yêsu pơhiăp giơ̆ng hơdôm tơlơi anŭn, Ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu, 
Ye know that after two days the passover takes place, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified. @ “Ƀing gih thâo laih dŏ dua hrơi dơ̆ng či truh phĕt Tơlơi Găn. Laih anŭn arăng či jao Ană Mơnuih brơi arăng pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal.”
Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together to the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas, @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing kŏng tha amăng ƀing ană plei pla pơƀŭt glaĭ amăng sang khua ngă yang prŏng hloh Kaip. 
and took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by subtlety and kill him; @ Gơñu črŏng sai mă Yêsu hăng tơlơi hơgơ̆m kiăng pơdjai hĭ Gơ̆. 
but they said, Not in the feast, that there be not a tumult among the people. @ Samơ̆ gơñu laĭ: “Ƀu dưi ôh ngă tơlơi anŭn tơdang phĕt Tơlơi Găn, hwĭ kơ hmâo tơlơi pơrŭng amăng tơ̆ng krah ană plei.”
But Jesus being in Bethany, in Simon the leper's house, @ Hlăk Yêsu dŏ pơ plei Bêthani amăng sang Simôn pô djơ̆ phŭng, 
a woman, having an alabaster flask of very precious ointment, came to him and poured it out upon his head as he lay at table. @ tơdang Ñu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi djă sa boh get boh pơtâo bă ia klôñ yom biă mă nao pơ Ñu hăng tuh ia klôñ anŭn ƀơi akŏ Ñu. 
But the disciples seeing it became indignant, saying, To what end [was] this waste? @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing ding kơna ƀuh tơlơi anŭn, gơñu hil biă mă hăng laĭ: “Yua hơgĕt pơrơngiă hĭ đôč đač kar hăng anŭn?

But Jesus knowing [it] said to them, Why do ye trouble the woman? for she has wrought a good work toward me. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu thâo tơlơi anŭn, tui anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Yua hơgĕt ƀing gih ngă pơgleh kơ đah kơmơi anai? Gơ̆ hmâo ngă laih sa bruă hiam kơ Kâo.

Then one of the twelve, he who was called Judas Iscariote, went to the chief priests @ Hlăk anŭn sa čô amăng pluh dua čô, anăn ñu Yudas Iskariôt, nao pơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng 
and said, What are ye willing to give me, and *I* will deliver him up to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver. @ laih anŭn laĭ: “Hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng ƀing gih či brơi kơ kâo tơdah kâo jao Yêsu kơ ƀing gih?” Ƀing anŭn brơi kơ ñu klâo pluh kak prăk. 
And from that time he sought a good opportunity that he might deliver him up. @ Dơ̆ng mơ̆ng mông anŭn ñu hơduah hrơi gal kiăng jao Yêsu kơ gơñu.
Now on the first [day] of [the feast of] unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? @ Hrơi tal sa amăng hrơi phĕt Ƀañ Tơpŭng Ƀu Hmâo Tơpơi ƀing ding kơna nao pơ Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Pơpă anih Ih kiăng gơmơi prăp rơmet kơ Ih ƀơ̆ng phĕt Tơlơi Găn?”
And he said, Go into the city unto such a one, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near, I will keep the passover in thy house with my disciples. @ Ñu laĭ: “Nao bĕ pơ sa čô mơnuih amăng plei prŏng laih anŭn laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Nai laĭ, mông Kâo giăm truh yơh. Kâo či pơhơdơr phĕt Tơlơi Găn amăng sang ih hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna kâo.’”
And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover. @ Ƀing ding kơna ngă tui kar hăng Yêsu hmâo pơtă laih kơ gơñu, laih anŭn gơñu prăp rơmet phĕt Tơlơi Găn.
And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve. @ Tơ adai mơmŏt laih, Ñu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing pluh dua čô ding kơna. 
And as they were eating he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up. @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă Ñu laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, sa čô amăng ƀing gih či pơblư̆ lui Kâo.”
And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him, each of them, Is it *I*, Lord? @ Ƀing gơñu rơngot biă mă, laih anŭn rĭm čô tŏ tui čơdơ̆ng tơña Yêsu tui anai: “Ơ Khua Yang, djơ̆ mơ̆ kâo?”
But he answering said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, *he* it is who shall deliver me up. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Hlơi pô añrŭ ƀañ tơpŭng amăng jam hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Kâo pô anŭn yơh pơblư̆ Kâo. 
The Son of man goes indeed, according as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; it were good for that man if he had not been born. @ Ană Mơnuih či djai tui hăng Hră Ơi Adai pơhiăp hmâo čih laih kơ Ñu, samơ̆ răm ƀăm yơh kơ pô pơblư̆ lui Ană Mơnuih!

And Judas, who delivered him up, answering said, Is it *I*, Rabbi? He says to him, *Thou* hast said. @ Yudas, pô pơblư̆ lui Ñu, laĭ: “Ơ Nai, djơ̆ mơ̆ kâo?” Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ih pô hmâo laĭ laih tơlơi anŭn.”
And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken [the] bread and blessed, broke [it] and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body. @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă, Yêsu mă ƀañ tơpŭng, iâu laĭ bơni hơơč, wơ̆k ƀañ tơpŭng hăng pơpha kơ ƀing ding kơna, hăng laĭ: “Mă ƀơ̆ng bĕ; anai jing drơi jan Kâo.” 
And having taken [the] cup and given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it. @ Laih anŭn Ñu mă kơčok, giơ̆ng iâu laĭ bơni hơơč, Ñu brơi kơčok kơ ƀing gơñu hăng laĭ: “Abih bang ƀing gih mơñum bĕ;

And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives. @ Giơ̆ng gơñu adoh, tơlơi adoh bơni hơơč, gơñu tơbiă nao pơ Čư̆ Ôliwơ.
Then saith Jesus to them, All *ye* shall be offended in me during this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Mlam anai abih bang ƀing gih či lui raih Kâo.

But after that I shall be risen, I will go before you to Galilee. @ Samơ̆ giơ̆ng Kâo hơdip glaĭ, Kâo či nao hlâo kơ ƀing gih pơ kwar Galilê”.
And Peter answering said to him, If all shall be offended in thee, *I* will never be offended. @ Pêtrôs pơhiăp hăng Ñu: “Wơ̆t dah abih bang či čơlah hĭ yua kơ Ih, kâo ƀu či čơlah lui Ih ôh.”
Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that during this night, before [the] cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ih, mlam anai yơh hlâo kơ mơnŭ tơdjô̆ ih či hơngah kơ Kâo klâo wơ̆t.”
Peter says to him, If I should needs die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. Likewise said all the disciples also. @ Pêtrôs laĭ kơ Ñu: “Wơ̆t dah kâo khŏm djai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ih tŭ mơ̆n, kâo ƀu či hơngah kơ Ih ôh.” Laih anŭn abih bang ƀing ding kơna laĭ kar hăng tui anŭn mơ̆n.
Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here until I go away and pray yonder. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn, Yêsu nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna pơ sa boh anih arăng pơanăn Gêtsêmanê. Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Dŏ ber bĕ ƀơi anai tơdang Kâo nao iâu laĭ pơ adih.” 
And taking with [him] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed. @ Ñu jak ba Pêtrôs hăng dua čô ană đah rơkơi Sêbêdê nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu. Ñu čơdơ̆ng rơngot ruă pran hăng rŭng răng. 
Then he says to them, My soul is very sorrowful even unto death; remain here and watch with me. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Bơngăt jua Kâo rơngot ruă biă mă tơl giăm djai; dŏ bĕ pơ anai laih anŭn krŏng hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Kâo.”
And going forward a little he fell upon his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as *I* will, but as *thou* [wilt]. @ Yêsu nao ataih ƀiă, bon kŭp ƀô̆ ƀơi lŏn, laih anŭn iâu laĭ: “Ơ Ama Kâo! Tơdah dưi, mă pơđuaĭ hĭ bĕ kơčok anai mơ̆ng Kâo; ƀu djơ̆ tui hăng Kâo kiăng ôh, samơ̆ tui hăng Ih kiăng.”
And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me? @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn Ñu wơ̆t glaĭ pơ ƀing ding kơna laih anŭn ƀuh gơñu dŏ pĭt. Ñu laĭ kơ Pêtrôs: “Ƀing gih ƀu dưi ôh hă dŏ krŏng hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Kâo sa mông? 
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] ready, but the flesh weak. @ Dŏ krŏng laih anŭn iâu laĭ bĕ, kiăng kơ ƀing gih ƀu lĕ ôh amăng tơlơi plư. Bơngăt jua kiăng biă mă, samơ̆ asar đeh tơdu”.
Again going away a second time he prayed saying, My Father, if this cannot pass [from me] unless I drink it, thy will be done. @ Ñu nao tal dua dơ̆ng laih anŭn iâu laĭ: “Ơ Ama Kâo! Tơdah kơčok anai ƀu dưi pơđuaĭ hĭ mơ̆ng Kâo ôh, khŏm Kâo mơñum, brơi tơlơi anŭn truh tui hăng Ih kiăng.” 
And coming he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. @ Yêsu wơ̆t glaĭ dơ̆ng hăng ƀuh ƀing ding kơna ăt dŏ pĭt, yua kơ mơta gơñu ƀu anăm blang ôh.
And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same thing. @ Tui anŭn, Ñu đuaĭ mơ̆ng ƀing gơñu dơ̆ng hăng nao iâu laĭ tal klâo, ăt rơkâo kar hăng boh pơhiăp hlâo anŭn mơ̆n. 
Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, Sleep on now and take your rest; behold, the hour has drawn nigh, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Ñu wơ̆t glaĭ pơ ƀing ding kơna hăng laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih ăt dŏ pĭt hăng dŏ pơdơi hă?

Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh. @ Tơgŭ bĕ, brơi ƀing ta nao! Lăng adih, pô pơblư̆ lui Kâo truh laih yơh.”
And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people. @ Tơdang Ñu dŏ pơhiăp, Yudas, sa čô amăng ƀing pluh dua čô, rai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing mơnuih lu djă đao gưm laih anŭn gai mơ̆ng ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing kŏng tha amăng ƀing ană plei pơkiaŏ rai. 
Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is: seize him. @ Pô pơblư̆ brơi laih gru kơnăl kơ ƀing anŭn, laĭ: “Hlơi pô kâo čŭm, Ñu yơh anŭn, mă čaŏ Ñu.”
And immediately coming up to Jesus he said, Hail, Rabbi, and covered him with kisses. @ Yudas nao pơ Yêsu mơtam hăng laĭ: “Kơkuh kơ Ih, Ơ Nai!” Laih anŭn čŭm Yêsu.
But Jesus said to him, [My] friend, for what purpose art thou come? Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ gơyut, ngă bĕ hơgĕt tơlơi kơñăm ih rai pơ anai kiăng ngă!” Tui anŭn, gơñu rai jĕ, mă Yêsu laih anŭn čaŏ hĭ Ñu. 
And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear. @ Laih anŭn anai nê, sa čô amăng ƀing dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu suă đao, koh hlŭn khua ngă yang prŏng hloh djơ̆ ƀơi tơngia ñu tơĭ hĭ.
Then saith Jesus to him, Return thy sword to its place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Jek glaĭ bĕ đao ih amăng hrŭm; yua kơ hlơi pô yua đao ñu či djai răm hăng đao mơ̆n. 
Or thinkest thou that I cannot now call upon my Father, and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels? @ Ih pơmĭn Kâo ƀu dưi ôh hă rơkâo kơ Ama, laih anŭn Ñu či pơkiaŏ rai mơtam kơ Kâo rơbeh kơ pluh dua phung tơhan ling jang? 
How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be? @ Samơ̆ tơdah tui anŭn, hyư̆m dưi pơsĭt Hră Ơi Adai pơhiăp hmâo čih laih kơ tơlơi anai?”
In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me? I sat daily [with you] teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me. @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing lu: “Yua hơgĕt ƀing gih djă đao laih anŭn gai kiăng mă Kâo kar hăng mă sa čô mơnuih klĕ? Rĭm hrơi Kâo dŏ pơtô amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu mă čaŏ Kâo ôh. 
But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. @ Samơ̆ abih bang tơlơi anai hmâo truh kiăng pơsĭt tơlơi ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo čih laih.” Hlăk anŭn abih bang ƀing ding kơna lui Ñu laih anŭn đuaĭ kơdŏp.
Now they that had seized Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. @ Ƀing mă laih Yêsu ba Ñu nao pơ sang khua ngă yang prŏng hloh Kaip. Pơ anŭn ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hăng ƀing kŏng tha hmâo pơtŭm glaĭ laih. 
And Peter followed him at a distance, even to the palace of the high priest, and entering in sat with the officers to see the end. @ Pêtrôs đuaĭ tui Yêsu mơ̆ng ataih ataih, truh pơ wăl sang khua ngă yang prŏng hloh. Ñu mŭt dŏ ber hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing tơhan gak wai kiăng lăng hơgĕt tơlơi či truh. 
And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death. @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng abih bang ƀing khua phat kơđi hơduah tơlơi gơ̆ng jơlan ƀlor pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ hăng Yêsu kiăng dưi pơdjai hĭ Ñu. 
And they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at the last two false witnesses came forward @ Samơ̆ gơñu ƀu ƀuh hơgĕt gĕt ôh, wơ̆t dah hmâo lu mơnuih rai ngă gơ̆ng jơlan ƀlor. Đŭt tơdơi hmâo dua čô rai, 
and said, *He* said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it. @ hăng laĭ: “Pô anai hmâo laĭ: ‘Kâo dưi pơrai hĭ sang kơkuh pơpŭ Ơi Adai hăng pơdơ̆ng glaĭ ñu dơ̆ng amăng klâo hrơi.’”
And the high priest standing up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee? @ Khua ngă yang prŏng hloh tơgŭ hăng laĭ: “Ih ƀu hmâo laĭ glaĭ ôh hă kơ tơlơi ƀing anŭn gơ̆ng jơlan pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ hăng Ih?” 
But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if *thou* art the Christ the Son of God. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu kơnơ̆ng dŏ rơiăt. Khua ngă yang prŏng hloh laĭ kơ Ñu: “Kâo pơđar kơ ih hăng anăn Ơi Adai hơdip, brơi Ih ƀuăn rơ̆ng, laĭ brơi ƀing gơmơi thâo djơ̆ mơ̆ Ih jing Yang Krist, Ană Ơi Adai?”
Jesus says to him, *Thou* hast said. Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ih pô hmâo laĭ laih tơlơi anŭn.

Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed: what need have we any more of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy. @ Hlăk anŭn khua ngă yang prŏng hloh hek ao ñu hăng laĭ: “Ñu hmâo pơhiăp pơgao hăng Ơi Adai.

What think ye? And they answering said, He is liable to the penalty of death. @ Hyư̆m ƀing gih pơmĭn?” Ƀing anŭn laĭ glaĭ: “Ñu lăp kơ djai yơh.”
Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and some struck him with the palms of their hand, @ Giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu kơčuh ia bah ƀơi ƀô̆ Yêsu hăng taih Ñu; hmâo đơđa pah meng Ñu, 
saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, Who is it who struck thee? @ hăng laĭ: “Ơ Yang Krist, laĭ lui hlâo brơi kơ gơmơi bĕ, hlơi pô hmâo taih Ih laih?”
But Peter sat without in the palace-court; and a maid came to him, saying, And *thou* wast with Jesus the Galilaean. @ Hlăk anŭn tơdang Pêtrôs dŏ ber pơ gah rơngiao wăl sang. Sa čô ding kơna đah kơmơi nao pơ ñu hăng laĭ: “Ih ăt jing mơnuih dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu, mơnuih Galilê mơ̆n.”
But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what thou sayest. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs hơngah mơtam ƀơi anăp abih bang gơñu, laĭ: “Kâo ƀu thâo ôh hơgĕt tơlơi ih laĭ anŭn.” 
And when he had gone out into the entrance, another [maid] saw him, and says to those there, This [man] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean. @ Tơdang ñu nao pơ amăng jang, sa čô ding kơna đah kơmơi pơkŏn ƀuh ñu, laĭ hăng ƀing mơnuih dŏ giăm ƀơi anŭn: “Pô anai hmâo dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu, mơnuih plei Nasaret.”
And again he denied with an oath: I do not know the man. @ Samơ̆ ñu hơngah dơ̆ng hăng ƀuăn rơ̆ng, laĭ: “Kâo ƀu thâo krăn ôh pô anŭn.”
And after a little, those who stood [there], coming to [him], said to Peter, Truly *thou* too art of them, for also thy speech makes thee manifest. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn ƀiă ƀing dŏ giăm pơ anŭn rai laĭ kơ Pêtrôs: “Sĭt biă mă ih ăt jing sa čô amăng ƀing anŭn mơ̆n, yua kơ săp ih pơhiăp bơrơđah hlơi ih jing.”
Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately [the] cock crew. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ñu čơdơ̆ng hơtơ̆m pah ñu pô hăng tơlơi ƀuăn rơ̆ng: “Kâo ƀu thâo krăn pô anŭn ôh.” Hlăk anŭn mơtam mơnŭ tơdjô̆.
And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said [to him], Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went forth without, and wept bitterly. @ Tui anŭn Pêtrôs hơdơr glaĭ boh pơhiăp Yêsu hmâo laĭ laih: “Hlâo kơ mơnŭ tơdjô̆ ih či hơngah kơ Kâo klâo wơ̆t.” Laih anŭn ñu tơbiă pơ gah rơngiao hia rơngot biă mă.
And when it was morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus so that they might put him to death. @ Truh ưm mơguah abih bang ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing kŏng tha amăng plei pla črŏng sai ngă kơ Yêsu kiăng pơdjai Ñu. 
And having bound him they led him away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor. @ Gơñu čaŏ hĭ Yêsu, hăng ba Ñu nao pơ Pilat khua čar.
Then Judas, who delivered him up, seeing that he had been condemned, filled with remorse, returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, @ Tơ Yudas jing pô pơblư̆ lui Yêsu ƀuh arăng klă kơđi kơ Yêsu, Yudas hơƀlŏk kơ tơlơi soh laih anŭn ba glaĭ hĭ klâo pluh kak prăk anŭn kơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing kŏng tha, hăng laĭ, 
saying, I have sinned [in] having delivered up guiltless blood. But they said, What is that to us? see *thou* [to that]. @ “Kâo hmâo ngă soh yua kơ jao brơi kơ ƀing gih drah Pô hơčih.” Ƀing anŭn laĭ: “Hơgĕt tơlơi anŭn djơ̆ kơ gơmơi? Anŭn jing bruă ih.”
And having cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, he left the place, and went away and hanged himself. @ Ñu glŏm hĭ prăk anŭn amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, laih anŭn ñu tơbiă nao hăng rot tơkuai ñu pô.
And the chief priests took the pieces of silver and said, It is not lawful to cast them into the Corban, since it is [the] price of blood. @ Samơ̆ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng mă prăk anŭn hăng laĭ: “Ƀu phiăn ôh pioh prăk anai amăng hip pioh prăk sang kơkuh pơpŭ, yua kơ anai jing prăk nua drah.” 
And having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter for a burying-ground for strangers. @ Tui anŭn gơñu črŏng sai, yua prăk anŭn blơi hmua pô bruă man lŏn, kiăng pioh dơr ƀing djuai tuai. 
Wherefore that field has been called Blood-field unto this day. @ Yua kơ anŭn arăng pơanăn hmua anŭn jing “Hmua Drah” truh pơ ră anai.
Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremias the prophet, saying, And I took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was set a price on, whom [they who were] of the sons of Israel had set a price on, @ Tui anŭn pơsĭt laih tơlơi pô laĭ lui hlâo Yêrêmi laĭ: “Gơñu mă klâo pluh kak prăk anŭn, jing nua ƀing ană Israel hmâo pơkă brơi laih kơ Ñu,

But Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor questioned him, saying, Art *thou* the King of the Jews? And Jesus said to him, Thou sayest. @ Yêsu dŏ gah anăp khua čar; laih anŭn khua čar tơña Ñu: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ Ih jing pơtao ană Yuđa?” Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Djơ̆ tui hăng ih laĭ laih.” 
And when he was accused of the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing. @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing kŏng tha phong pơčŭt kơ Ñu, Ñu ƀu laĭ glaĭ ôh.
Then says Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? @ Tui anŭn, Pilat laĭ kơ Ñu: “Ih ƀu hmư̆ ôh hă gơñu phong pơčŭt lu tơlơi pơkơdơ̆ng hăng Ih?”
And he answered him not so much as one word, so that the governor wondered exceedingly. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu ƀu laĭ glaĭ ôh, wơ̆t dah kơnơ̆ng sa boh pơhiăp đôč. Yua kơ anŭn khua čar hling hlang biă mă.

And they had then a notable prisoner, named Barabbas. @ Hlăk anŭn hmâo sa čô mơnă anăn ñu Yêsu Barabas, hing ang sat biă mă. 
They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said to them, Whom will ye that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ? @ Tui anŭn tơdang ƀing mơnuih lu pơtŭm glaĭ, Pilat tơña ƀing gơñu: “Hlơi pô ƀing gih kiăng kâo phư brơi, Yêsu Barabas ƀôdah Yêsu arăng iâu Krist?” 
For he knew that they had delivered him up through envy. @ Yua kơ ñu thâo arăng jao Yêsu kơ ñu yua kơ tơlơi gơñu moañ.
But, as he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous [man]; for I have suffered to-day many things in a dream because of him. @ Tơdang ñu dŏ ƀơi gre phat kơđi, bơnai ñu pơkiaŏ nao arăng laĭ kơ ñu: “Anăm ngă tơlơi hơgĕt ôh kơ mơnuih hiam tơpă anŭn, yua kơ Ñu yơh ră anai amăng tơlơi rơpơi kâo hmâo lu tơlơi rŭng răng.”
But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should beg for Barabbas, and destroy Jesus. @ Samơ̆ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing kŏng tha pơsur ƀing ană plei pla rơkâo pŏk Barabas laih anŭn pơdjai Yêsu. 
And the governor answering said to them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas. @ Khua čar tơña kơ ƀing gơñu dơ̆ng: “Hlơi amăng ƀing dua čô anai ƀing gih kiăng kơ kâo pŏk brơi ƀing gih?” Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Barabas.” 
Pilate says to them, What then shall I do with Jesus, who is called Christ? They all say, Let him be crucified. @ Pilat laĭ kơ gơñu: “Tui anŭn hơgĕt kâo či ngă hăng Yêsu arăng iâu Krist?” Abih bang gơñu laĭ: “Pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal!” 
And the governor said, What evil then has he done? But they cried more than ever, saying, Let him be crucified. @ Tui anŭn Pilat tơña: “Yua hơgĕt, hơgĕt tơlơi sat Ñu hmâo ngă?” Samơ̆ abih bang ƀing gơñu ur kơtang hloh dơ̆ng: “Pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal.”
And Pilate, seeing that it availed nothing, but that rather a tumult was arising, having taken water, washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am guiltless of the blood of this righteous one: see *ye* [to it]. @ Tui anŭn Pilat thâo ñu ƀu dưi ngă hơgĕt ôh, samơ̆ hmâo dơnai pơrơông pơrơang jai kơtang hloh dơ̆ng, ñu mă ia laih anŭn rao tơngan ñu ƀơi anăp ƀing mơnuih lu anŭn hăng laĭ: “Kâo ƀu soh hăng drah mơnuih anai ôh!

And all the people answering said, His blood [be] on us and on our children. @ Abih bang ƀing ană plei pla laĭ glaĭ: “Brơi drah ñu lĕ ƀơi ƀing gơmơi hăng ƀơi ƀing ană gơmơi!” 
Then he released to them Barabbas; but Jesus, having scourged [him], he delivered up that he might be crucified. @ Tui anŭn Pilat pŏk Barabas brơi kơ ƀing gơñu, laih anŭn brơi arăng taih Yêsu hăng gai, ñu jao Yêsu brơi arăng pơ̆ng ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal.
Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus with [them] to the praetorium, gathered against him the whole band, @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing tơhan khua čar ba Yêsu amăng sang khua čar, laih anŭn abih bang tơpul tơhan gơñu pơƀŭt glaĭ jum dar Ñu.

And having spit upon him, they took the reed and beat [him] on his head. @ Gơñu kơčuh ia bah ƀơi Ñu, laih anŭn mă gai trang bô anŭn taih jeñ ƀơi akŏ Ñu. 
And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak off him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify. @ Giơ̆ng gơñu djik djak Yêsu laih, gơñu toh hĭ ao phyung mriah laih anŭn buh glaĭ ao Ñu, giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu ba Yêsu nao pơ anih kiăng pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal.

[And] in like manner the chief priests also, mocking, with the scribes and elders, said, @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n wơ̆t ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt laih anŭn ƀing kŏng tha djik djak kơ Yêsu laih anŭn laĭ, 
He saved others, himself he cannot save. He is King of Israel: let him descend now from the cross, and we will believe on him. @ “Ñu hmâo pơklaih laih arăng, samơ̆ Ñu ƀu dưi pơklaih ôh Ñu pô. Ñu jing pơtao ană Israel; brơi Ñu trŭn mơ̆ng kơyâo bơrơkal ră anai ƀing ta či đaŏ Ñu yơh.

And the robbers also who had been crucified with him cast the same reproaches on him. @ Wơ̆t ƀing klĕ arăng pơ̆ng ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu ăt toh djraĭ kơ Ñu kar kaĭ mơ̆n.
Now from [the] sixth hour there was darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour; @ Mơ̆ng mông tal năm truh pơ mông tal dua rơpăn hmâo tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt gom abih čar anŭn. 
but about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? @ Kơplah wah mông tal dua rơpăn Yêsu iâu kraih kơtang: “Êli! Êli! Lama sabaktani?” Kiăng laĭ: “Ơ Ơi Adai kâo, Ơ Ơi Adai kâo, yua hơgĕt Ih lui hĭ Kâo?” 
And some of those who stood there, when they heard [it], said, This [man] calls for Elias. @ Hmâo đơđa ƀing mơnuih dŏ jĕ pơ anŭn hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơñu laĭ: “Pô anai iâu Êli.” 
And immediately one of them running and getting a sponge, having filled [it] with vinegar and fixed [it] on a reed, gave him to drink. @ Tañ mơtam sa čô amăng ƀing gơñu nao mă pông diăn añrŭ amăng ia tơpai mơsăm, kă ƀơi jŭng gai trang bô, laih anŭn yơr brơi Yêsu mơñum. 
But the rest said, Let be; let us see if Elias comes to save him. @ Samơ̆ ƀing pơkŏn laĭ: “Tơguan amơĭ! Brơi ƀing ta dŏ krăp lăng thâo dah Êli rai pơklaih Ñu mơ̆n thâo.”
And Jesus, having again cried with a loud voice, gave up the ghost. @ Yêsu ur kraih kơtang sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng laih anŭn tơĭ pran.
And lo, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were rent, @ Laih anŭn anai nê, khăn păng amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ tơhek hĭ jing dua mơ̆ng ngŏ truh pơ yŭ; lŏn pơpư̆ pơgơi, lu boh pơtâo čơđang pơčah hĭ;

But the centurion, and they who were with him on guard over Jesus, seeing the earthquake and the things that took place, feared greatly, saying, Truly this [man] was Son of God. @ Tơ khua tơhan hăng ƀing tơhan gak wai Yêsu, ƀuh tơlơi lŏn tơnah pơpư̆ laih anŭn abih bang tơlơi hmâo truh laih, gơñu hwĭ biă mă hăng laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Mơnuih anai jing Ană Ơi Adai!”
And there were there many women beholding from afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee ministering to him, @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n pơ anŭn hmâo lu ƀing đah kơmơi dŏ lăng mơ̆ng ataih, ƀing hmâo tui Yêsu mơ̆ng kwar Galilê jing ƀing hmâo mă bruă laih kơ Ñu.

And Joseph having got the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, @ Yôsep mă drơi jan, ñu pŏn lom Ñu hăng khăn kơbuă rơgoh, 
and laid it in his new tomb which he had hewn in the rock; and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, went away. @ laih anŭn pơđih Yêsu amăng pơsat phrâo, Yôsep hmâo phă laih pioh kơ ñu pô. Ñu tơglung sa boh pơtâo prŏng kơđơ̆l hĭ bah amăng pơsat, giơ̆ng anŭn ñu glaĭ yơh. 
But Mary of Magdala was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the sepulchre. @ HʼMari Madala hăng HʼMari pơkŏn dŏ ber klă anăp pơsat.
Now on the morrow, which is after the preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate, @ Hrơi tŏ tui, hrơi tơdơi kơ hrơi prăp rơmet phĕt Tơlơi Găn, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing Pharisi pơƀŭt glaĭ ƀơi anăp Pilat,

Command therefore that the sepulchre be secured until the third day, lest his disciples should come and steal him away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first. @ Tui anŭn rơkâo kơ ih pơđar arăng gak wai pơsat ten en tơl truh hrơi tal klâo, hwĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu nao klĕ mă drơi jan Ñu laih anŭn nao laĭ pơthâo kơ ƀing ană plei: ‘Ñu hơdip glaĭ laih mơ̆ng ƀing djai.’ Tơlơi ƀlor tơdơi anŭn či jing sat hloh kơ hlâo dơ̆ng.” 
And Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, secure it as well as ye know how. @ Pilat laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih hmâo laih ƀing tơhan gak; nao bĕ, laih anŭn gak wai pơsat ten en tui hăng tơlơi ƀing gih thâo.” 
And they went and secured the sepulchre, having sealed the stone, with the watch [besides]. @ Tui anŭn gơñu nao kơđŏm hnal boh pơtâo kơđơ̆l bah amăng pơsat, laih anŭn pioh ƀing tơhan gak wai.
Now late on sabbath, as it was the dusk of the next day after sabbath, came Mary of Magdala and the other Mary to look at the sepulchre. @ Tơdơi kơ hrơi saƀat, hlăk sêng brêng ưm mơguah hrơi tal sa amăng hrơi kơ̆m, HʼMari Madala hăng HʼMari pơkŏn nao čuă lăng pơsat. 
And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of [the] Lord, descending out of heaven, came and rolled away the stone and sat upon it. @ Laih anŭn, anai nê blĭp blăp mơtam hmâo tơlơi pơpư̆ lŏn tơnah kơtang, yua kơ hmâo sa čô ling jang Khua Yang trŭn mơ̆ng adai rai tơglung lui hĭ hnal boh pơtâo kơđơ̆l bah amăng pơsat, laih anŭn dŏ ber ƀơi hăng ngŏ boh pơtâo anŭn. 
And his look was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow. @ Rup ñu bơngač bang kar hăng kơmlă, ao ñu kŏ kar hăng pler. 
And for fear of him the guards trembled and became as dead men. @ Ƀing tơhan hwĭ kơ ñu, tơtư̆ tơl jing hĭ kar hăng mơnuih djai.
And the angel answering said to the women, Fear not *ye*, for I know that ye seek Jesus the crucified one. @ Samơ̆ ling jang hiam laĭ kơ ƀing đah kơmơi: “Anăm hwĭ ôh; yua kơ kâo thâo ƀing ih nao sem lăng Yêsu, Pô arăng hmâo pơ̆ng laih ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal.

And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to bring his disciples word. @ Tui anŭn tañ mơtam gơñu đuaĭ mơ̆ng pơsat hăng tơlơi hwĭ wơ̆t hăng tơlơi hơ̆k mơak biă mă, laih anŭn nao laĭ pơthâo kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu.
And as they went to bring his disciples word, behold also, Jesus met them, saying, Hail! And they coming up took him by the feet, and did him homage. @ Plŭt mơtam Yêsu bưp ƀing đah kơmơi anŭn hăng laĭ: “Kơkuh kơ ƀing gih!” Gơñu nao giăm, kuar tơkai Yêsu laih anŭn bon kơkuh kơ Ñu. 
Then Jesus says to them, Fear not; go, bring word to my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there they shall see me. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Anăm hwĭ ôh; nao laĭ pơthâo kơ ƀing adơi ayŏng Kâo, brơi gơñu nao pơ kwar Galilê, pơ anŭn gơñu či ƀuh Kâo.”
And as they went, behold, some of the watch went into the city, and brought word to the chief priests of all that had taken place. @ Tơdang gơñu nao, hmâo đơđa ƀing tơhan gak wai mŭt amăng plei Yêrusalem pơthâo glaĭ kơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng abih tơlơi hmâo truh laih. 
And having assembled with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, @ Giơ̆ng kơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng bơjơnum črŏng sai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing kŏng tha; gơñu brơi kơ ƀing tơhan sa nua prăk lu biă mă,

And if this should come to the hearing of the governor, *we* will persuade him, and save *you* from all anxiety. @ Tơdah khua kwar hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, ƀing gơmơi či alum pơđur ñu, hăng pơgang brơi ƀing gih huaĭ hmâo tơlơi rŭng bơngơ̆t ôh.”
And they took the money and did as they had been taught. And this report is current among the Jews until this day. @ Tui anŭn ƀing tơhan mă prăk anŭn hăng ngă tui kar hăng tơlơi arăng hmâo pơtă laih kơ gơñu; tơlơi anŭn arăng ăt dŏ ruai glaĭ tơ̆ng krah ƀing Yuđa truh pơ hrơi anai.

And when they saw him, they did homage to him: but some doubted. @ Tơ gơñu ƀuh Yêsu, gơñu bon kơkuh kơ Ñu, samơ̆ hmâo đơđa mơnuih dŏ đing. 
And Jesus coming up spoke to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth. @ Yêsu nao giăm gơñu hăng laĭ: “Abih bang tơlơi dưi amăng adai laih anŭn ƀơi lŏn tơnah hmâo jao brơi laih kơ Kâo. 
Go [therefore] and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit; @ Tui anŭn, nao bĕ laih anŭn pơjing abih bang djuai mơnuih jing hĭ ding kơna Kâo, ngă ƀatem kơ ƀing gơñu hăng anăn Ama, Ană, laih anŭn Yang Bơngăt Hiam;

Beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Christ, Son of God; @ Čơdơ̆ng phŭn kơ Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ Yêsu Krist, Ană Ơi Adai.

There came John baptising in the wilderness, and preaching [the] baptism of repentance for remission of sins. @ Yôhan hmâo rai laih amăng tơdrŏn tač, ñu pơtô laih anŭn ngă ƀatem kơ tơlơi kơhmal tơlơi soh kiăng hmâo tơlơi Ơi Adai pap brơi tơlơi soh. 
And there went out to him all the district of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptised by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. @ Abih bang mơnuih mơ̆ng tring Yuđa hăng abih bang ană plei Yêrusalem leng nao pơ ñu.

And John was clothed in camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and ate locusts and wild honey. @  Yôhan buh ao blâu aseh samô, hăng hrăng hơdrăng kơiăng klĭ. Ñu ƀơ̆ng kơtop hăng ia hơni glai. 
And he preached, saying, There comes he that is mightier than I after me, the thong of whose sandals I am not fit to stoop down and unloose. @ Ñu pơtô tui anai: “Pô rai tơdơi kơ kâo, jing mơyang hloh kơ kâo, laih anŭn kâo ƀu lăp ôh tơkui kleh hrĕ klĭ juă Ñu.

And it came to pass in those days [that] Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John at the Jordan. @ Amăng khul hrơi anŭn, Yêsu rai mơ̆ng plei Nasaret kwar Galilê, laih anŭn Yôhan ngă ƀatem kơ Ñu amăng ia krong Yurdan. 
And straightway going up from the water, he saw the heavens parting asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descending upon him. @ Tơdang Yêsu tơgŭ mơ̆ng ia, Ñu ƀuh khul adai pŏk, laih anŭn Yang Bơngăt Hiam trŭn găm ƀơi Ñu kar hăng sa drơi čĭm bơrơgơ̆m. 
And there came a voice out of the heavens: *Thou* art my beloved Son, in thee I have found my delight. @ Laih anŭn hmâo asăp pơhiăp mơ̆ng adai laĭ: “Ih jing Ană Kâo khăp hơeng, amăng Ih Kâo hmâo tơlơi hơ̆k mơak biă mă.”
And immediately the Spirit drives him out into the wilderness. @ Tañ mơtam Yang Bơngăt Hiam pơtrŭt Ñu nao pơ tơdrŏn tač. 
And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan, and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him. @ Ñu dŏ amăng tơdrŏn tač pă pluh hrơi, laih anŭn tŭ tơlơi satan plư Ñu. Ñu dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng hlô glai; laih anŭn ƀing ling jang Ơi Adai djru Ñu.
But after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of God, @ Giơ̆ng kơ arăng krư̆ hĭ Yôhan, Yêsu nao pơ kwar Galilê pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam Ơi Adai. 
and saying, The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has drawn nigh; repent and believe in the glad tidings. @ Ñu laĭ: “Mông truh laih, laih anŭn dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai hmâo rai giăm yơh. Kơhmal bĕ tơlơi soh laih anŭn đaŏ kơ Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam.”
And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew, [Simon's] brother, casting out a net in the sea, for they were fishers. @ Tơdang Yêsu rơbat kơtuai hang ia rơsĭ Galilê, Ñu ƀuh Simôn hăng Andrê adơi Simôn. Gơñu dŏ dăng hơñual amăng ia rơsĭ, yua kơ gơñu jing mơnuih trah akan. 
And Jesus said to them, Come after me, and I will make you become fishers of men; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Đuaĭ tui Kâo bĕ, laih anŭn Kâo či pơjing ƀing gih mơnuih trah mơnuih.” 
and straightway leaving their trawl-nets they followed him. @ Tañ mơtam gơñu lui hĭ hơñual gơñu hăng đuaĭ tui Yêsu.
And going on thence a little, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, and these [were] in the ship repairing the trawl-nets; @ Tơ Ñu nao ataih ƀiă, Ñu ƀuh Yakơ ană đah rơkơi Sêbêdê hăng Yôhan adơi ñu, gơñu dŏ pơsir hơñual amăng sŏng.

And they go into Capernaum. And straightway on the sabbath he entered into the synagogue and taught. @ Gơñu nao pơ plei Kapernum; amăng hrơi saƀat Yêsu mŭt amăng sang bơjơnum Yuđa laih anŭn pơtô pơhrăm. 
And they were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes. @ Abih mơnuih leng kơ hling hlang kơ tơlơi Ñu pơtô, yua kơ Ñu pơtô kơ ƀing gơ̆ ƀu djơ̆ kar hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt ôh, kơđai glaĭ, Ñu pơtô hăng tơlơi dưi.
And there was in their synagogue a man [possessed] by an unclean spirit, and he cried out @ Hlăk anŭn, amăng sang bơjơnum ƀing gơñu hmâo sa čô mơnuih hmâo yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak dŏ amăng ñu;

And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace and come out of him. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu ƀuah ñu, hăng laĭ: “Dŏ rơiăt hăng tơbiă bĕ mơ̆ng mơnuih anai.”
And the unclean spirit, having torn him, and uttered a cry with a loud voice, came out of him. @ Yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak prăh kơñak drơi jan ñu, ur kraih laih anŭn tơbiă mơ̆ng mơnuih anŭn. 
And all were amazed, so that they questioned together among themselves, saying, What is this? what new doctrine is this? for with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. @ Abih bang gơñu leng kơ hling hlang, hăng tơña tơdruă gơñu: “Hơgĕt tơlơi anai?

And his fame went out straightway into the whole region of Galilee around. @ Laih anŭn tañ mơtam tơlơi hing ang Ñu arăng hmư̆ tar ƀar tring jum dar kwar Galilê.
And straightway going out of the synagogue, they came with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew. @ Tơbiă mơ̆ng sang bơjơnum, Yêsu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yakơ laih anŭn Yôhan nao tơpă pơ sang Simôn hăng Andrê. 
And the mother-in-law of Simon lay in a fever. And straightway they speak to him about her. @ Tơhmua đah kơmơi Simôn duăm dŏ đih ƀơi sưng. Gơñu laĭ pơthâo kơ Yêsu mơtam kơ tơlơi gơ̆ ruă pơgrŭn.

But evening being come, when the sun had gone down, they brought to him all that were suffering, and those possessed by demons; @ Ƀơi yang hrơi lĕ klam anŭn, arăng ba nao pơ Yêsu abih bang ƀing duăm ruă hăng ƀing hmâo yang sat ngă. 
and the whole city was gathered together at the door. @ Abih bang ƀing mơnuih amăng plei anŭn pơtŭm glaĭ ƀơi anăp bah amăng. 
And he healed many suffering from various diseases; and he cast out many demons, and did not suffer the demons to speak because they knew him. @ Yêsu pơsuaih lu mơnuih hmâo tơlơi ruă phara phara hăng puh pơđuaĭ lu yang sat. Ñu khă ƀu brơi yang sat pơhiăp ôh, yua kơ ƀing gơñu thâo krăn Yêsu.

and having found him, they say to him, All seek thee. @ Tơ gơñu ƀuh Yêsu gơñu laĭ hăng Ñu: “Abih bang mơnuih hyu sem Ih.”
And he says to them, Let us go elsewhere into the neighbouring country towns, that I may preach there also, for for this purpose am I come forth. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu: “Brơi ƀing ta nao pơ plei jĕ giăm jum dar anai kiăng kơ Kâo dưi pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam pơ anŭn kar kaĭ mơ̆n; yua kơ tơlơi anŭn yơh Kâo hmâo rai laih.”

and says to him, See thou say nothing to any one, but go, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing what Moses ordained, for a testimony to them. @ “Răng bĕ, anăm laĭ tơlơi anai kơ arăng ôh, samơ̆ nao pơdah ih pô kơ khua ngă yang, laih anŭn pơyơr mơnơ̆ng ngă yang yua kơ tơlơi ih rơgoh laih kar hăng tơlơi juăt Môis hmâo pơtă laih, jing sa tơlơi gơ̆ng jơlan brơi kơ ană plei pla.”
But he, having gone forth, began to proclaim [it] much, and to spread the matter abroad, so that he could no longer enter openly into the city, but was without in desert places, and they came to him from every side. @ Samơ̆ ñu tơbiă nao hăng čơdơ̆ng ră ruai laih anŭn pơhaih tơlơi anŭn tar ƀar.

And he entered again into Capernaum after [several] days, and it was reported that he was at [the] house; @ Giơ̆ng kơ ƀiă hrơi mơ̆ng anŭn, Yêsu wơ̆t glaĭ pơ plei Kapernum, laih anŭn arăng thâo Ñu dŏ amăng sang. 
and straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them. @ Hnŭn yơh hmâo lu mơnuih pơtŭm glaĭ bă amăng sang tơl ƀu hmâo anih kơ gơñu ôh, wơ̆t ƀơi gah anăp bah amăng sang kŏn hmâo anih rơhông lơi. Laih anŭn Yêsu dŏ pơtô tơlơi Ơi Adai pơhiăp kơ gơñu. 
And there come to him [men] bringing a paralytic, borne by four; @ Hlăk anŭn hmâo pă čô mơnuih čơkung ba sa čô rơwen pơ Ñu. 
and, not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having dug [it] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay. @ Yua kơ mơnuih lu, gơñu ƀu dưi ba gơ̆ nao giăm Yêsu ôh, hnŭn yơh gơñu pŏk hĭ bơbŭng sang hăng ngŏ ƀơi anih Yêsu dŏ. Mơ̆ng amăng anŭn gơñu pơañreng trŭn pô rơwen hrŏm hơbĭt hăng kiao gơ̆ đih. 
But Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven [thee]. @ Tơ Yêsu ƀuh tơlơi đaŏ gơñu, Ñu laĭ kơ pô rơwen: “Ơ ană, tơlơi soh ih hmâo pap brơi laih.”
But certain of the scribes were there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts, @ Hmâo đơđa nai pơtô tơlơi juăt dŏ ber pơ anŭn tơña amăng pran jua gơñu, 
Why does this [man] thus speak? he blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except God alone? @ “Hyư̆m mơnuih anai pơhiăp pơgao tui anŭn? Ñu pơhiăp pơgao hăng Ơi Adai! Hlơi dưi pap brơi tơlơi soh, kơnơ̆ng hơjăn Ơi Adai đôč?”
And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts? @ Amăng tơlơi pơmĭn Yêsu thâo mơtam kơ tơlơi ƀing anŭn tơña amăng tơlơi pơmĭn, laih anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu: “Hyư̆m ƀing gih hmâo tơlơi tơña amăng pran jua ƀing gih kar hăng anŭn? 
Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven [thee]; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk? @ Hơgĕt tơlơi amuñ hloh laĭ kơ pô rơwen: ‘Tơlơi soh ih hmâo pap brơi laih,’ ƀôdah laĭ: ‘Tơgŭ bĕ, mă kiao ih hăng rơbat nao?’ 
But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic, @ Samơ̆ kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi thâo kơ Ană Mơnuih ƀơi lŏn tơnah anai hmâo tơlơi dưi pap brơi tơlơi soh” — Ñu laĭ kơ pô rơwen: — 
To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house. @ “Kâo laĭ kơ ih, tơgŭ bĕ, mă ba kiao ih hăng glaĭ pơ sang.” 
And he rose up straightway, and, having taken up his couch, went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus. @ Pô rơwen tơgŭ, tañ mơtam mă kiao ñu hăng tơbiă nao ƀơi anăp abih bang ƀing gơñu; tui anŭn abih bang gơñu leng kơtuă hling hlang hăng pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai, hăng laĭ: “Ƀing ta aka ƀuh djơ̆ ôh tơlơi kar hăng anai.”
And he went out again by the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them. @ Yêsu tơbiă nao dơ̆ng pơ hang ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn abih bang mơnuih lu pơtŭm jum dar Ñu; laih anŭn Ñu pơtô kơ ƀing gơñu. 
And passing by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and says to him, Follow me. And he rose up and followed him. @ Tơdang Yêsu găn pơ anŭn Ñu ƀuh Lêwi ană Alphê dŏ ber amăng anih ring jia, laih anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ Lêwi: “Đuaĭ tui Kâo bĕ.” Tui anŭn Lêwi tơgŭ hăng đuaĭ tui Ñu.
And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him. @ Tơdang Yêsu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă amăng sang Lêwi, hmâo lu ƀing ring jia wơ̆t ƀing mơnuih soh dŏ ber ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu laih anŭn hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu; yua kơ hmâo lu mơnuih hmâo đuaĭ tui Yêsu. 
And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers, said to his disciples, Why [is it] that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners? @ Tơ ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt amăng ƀing Pharisi ƀuh Yêsu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing soh wơ̆t hăng ƀing ring jia, gơñu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Yêsu: “Yua hơgĕt Ñu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ring jia laih anŭn hăng ƀing mơnuih soh?”
And Jesus having heard [it] says to them, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill. I have not come to call righteous [men], but sinners. @ Tơ Yêsu hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, Ñu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀu djơ̆ ƀing mơnuih hiam drơi jan ôh kiăng kơ nai ia jrao, samơ̆ ƀing duăm ruă. Ƀu djơ̆ Kâo rai kiăng kơ iâu ƀing mơnuih tơpă ôh, samơ̆ iâu ƀing mơnuih soh.”
And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and [the disciples] of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing ding kơna Yôhan hăng ƀing Pharisi hmâo tơlơi ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă.

And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Dưi mơ̆ ƀing arăng iâu kơ tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă dŏ rơkơi bơnai ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă tơdang han tao ăt dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu?

But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then shall they fast in that day. @ Samơ̆ hrơi či truh tơ arăng mă pơđuaĭ hĭ pô dŏ bơnai mơ̆ng ƀing gơñu, hlăk anŭn gơñu či ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă yơh.
No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment: otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old [stuff], and there is a worse rent. @ Ƀu hmâo ôh mơnuih sĭt bơnal phrâo pơklep hăng ao so. Tơdah ngă tui anŭn bơnal phrâo či pơtơĭ hĭ ao so, laih anŭn anih tơĭ či tơhek hĭ prŏng jai. 
And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine is to be put into new skins. @ Laih anŭn ƀu hmâo ôh mơnuih tro ia tơpai phrâo amăng get klĭ so; tơdah ngă tui anŭn tơpai či blôk pơčah hĭ get anŭn, tơpai či hŏk hĭ, wơ̆t get ăt či rơngiă mơ̆n.”
And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears. @  Hmâo sa hrơi saƀat Yêsu găn amăng hmua pơdai tơpŭng. Tơdang gơñu rơbat ƀing ding kơna Ñu ruač amŭng pơdai tơpŭng. 
And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful? @ Ƀing Pharisi laĭ kơ Ñu: “Lăng adih, yua hơgĕt gơñu ngă tơlơi ƀu phiăn dưi ngă ôh amăng hrơi saƀat?”
And *he* said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, *he* and those with him, @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih aka đŏk djơ̆ ôh hă tơlơi ră ruai kơ tơlơi Đawit hmâo ngă, hlăk ñu laih anŭn ƀing hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu rơpa? 
how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him? @ Amăng rơnŭk Abiathar ngă khua ngă yang prŏng hloh, ñu mŭt amăng sang Ơi Adai hăng ƀơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng pơyơr kơ Ơi Adai, laih anŭn brơi wơ̆t ƀing mơnuih nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu ăt ƀơ̆ng mơ̆n, wơ̆t dah ƀañ tơpŭng anŭn kơnơ̆ng pioh kơ ƀing khua ngă yang đôč dưi ƀơ̆ng, pô pơkŏn ƀu dưi ƀơ̆ng ôh.”
And he said to them, The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath; @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ơi Adai pơjing hrơi saƀat yua kơ ană mơnuih, ƀu djơ̆ ôh Ơi Adai pơjing ană mơnuih yua kơ hrơi saƀat. 
so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also. @ Tui anŭn Ană Mơnuih ăt jing khua kơ hrơi saƀat mơ̆n.”
And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was there a man having his hand dried up. @ Sa wơ̆t pơkŏn, Yêsu mŭt amăng sang bơjơnum, laih anŭn pơ anŭn hmâo sa čô đah rơkơi jo sa ƀĕ tơngan. 
And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him. @ Đơđa mơnuih krăp lăng sŭ Yêsu thâo dah Ñu či pơsuaih mơnuih anŭn amăng hrơi saƀat mơ̆n thâo, kiăng kơ dưi pơčŭt Ñu. 
And he says to the man who had his hand dried up, Rise up [and come] into the midst. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ đah rơkơi hmâo tơngan jo anŭn: “Tơgŭ rai dŏ tơ̆ng krah anai.” 
And he says to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill? But they were silent. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu tơña kơ gơñu: “Amăng hrơi saƀat ƀing ta dưi ngă tơlơi hiam ƀôdah ngă tơlơi sat, pơklaih mơnuih ƀôdah pơdjai mơnuih?” Samơ̆ gơñu leng kơ dŏ rơiăt. 
And looking round upon them with anger, distressed at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and his hand was restored. @ Ñu lăng jum dar kơ ƀing anŭn hăng tơlơi hil, rơngot kơ pran jua yua kơ gơñu kơpĭl, laih anŭn laĭ kơ đah rơkơi anŭn: “Yơr bĕ tơngan ih” Gơ̆ yơr, laih anŭn tơngan gơ̆ suaih. 
And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him. @ Ƀing Pharisi tơbiă laih anŭn tañ mơtam gơñu črŏng sai hơgơ̆m hăng ƀing mơnuih gah kơ Hêrôt pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ Yêsu kiăng hơduah tơlơi dưi pơdjai Ñu.
And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea, @ Yêsu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna nao pơ ia rơsĭ, hmâo sa phung mơnuih lu biă mă mơ̆ng kwar Galilê, mơ̆ng Yuđa đuaĭ tui Ñu,

And he spoke to his disciples, in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon him. @ Yua kơ ƀing mơnuih lu Ñu pơtă kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu pre pioh sa boh sŏng anĕt kơ Ñu, hwĭ kơ gơñu bing kơpĭ Ñu.

And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried saying, *Thou* art the Son of God. @ Rĭm wơ̆t ƀing yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak ƀuh Yêsu, gơñu bon ƀơi anăp Ñu hăng ur kraih: “Ih jing Ană Ơi Adai”.
And he rebuked them much, that they might not make him manifest. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu khă pơtă gơñu anăm pơhaih Ñu kơ hlơi hlơi ôh.
And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him. @ Yêsu đĭ pơ čư̆, Ñu iâu ƀing mơnuih Ñu kiăng; laih anŭn gơñu nao pơ Ñu yơh.

And having called them to [him], he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? @ Yêsu iâu ƀing anŭn rai pơ Ñu hăng laĭ kơ gơñu hăng tơlơi bơhmutu: “Hyư̆m Satan dưi puh pơđuaĭ Satan lĕ?

because they said, He has an unclean spirit. @ Yêsu laĭ tui anŭn yua kơ gơñu laĭ: “Yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak ngă Ñu.”
And his brethren and his mother come, and standing without sent to him calling him. @ Laih anŭn amĭ Ñu hăng ƀing adơi ayŏng Ñu rai, dŏ pơ gah rơngiao. Gơñu pơkiaŏ nao arăng iâu Ñu.

And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren? @ Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Hlơi jing amĭ Kâo? Hlơi jing adơi ayŏng Kâo?” 
And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren: @ Laih anŭn Yêsu lăng kơ ƀing dŏ jum dar Ñu hăng laĭ: “Anai amĭ Kâo hăng ƀing adơi ayŏng Kâo!

And again he began to teach by the sea. And a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that going on board ship he sat in the sea, and all the crowd were close to the sea on the land. @  Sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng Yêsu čơdơ̆ng pơtô ƀơi hang ia rơsĭ Galilê, laih anŭn hmâo sa phung mơnuih lu biă mă pơtŭm jum dar Ñu.

The sower sows the word: @ Mơnuih sai pơjeh anŭn jing sai boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai.

And these are they in like manner who are sown upon the rocky places, who when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy, @ Kar hăng tui anŭn mơ̆n ƀing mă tŭ pơjeh amăng anih lŏn boh pơtâo: tơ gơñu hmư̆ boh pơhiăp, hăng tơlơi hơ̆k mơak gơñu mă tŭ mơtam, 
and they have no root in themselves, but are for a time: then, tribulation arising, or persecution on account of the word, immediately they are offended. @ Samơ̆ amăng gơñu pô ƀu hmâo akha ôh, kơnơ̆ng dŏ jang jai đôč. Laih anŭn tơ hmâo tơlơi tơnap ƀôdah tơlơi arăng ngă sat yua kơ boh pơhiăp anŭn, gơñu lĕ rơbuh mơtam. 
And others are they who are sown among the thorns: these are they who have heard the word, @ Đơđa pơjeh pơkŏn lĕ ƀơi pum drơi jing kar hăng ƀing mơnuih hmư̆ boh hiăp pơtô, 
and the cares of life, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. @ samơ̆ tơlơi ƀlơ̆ng bơngơ̆t kơ lŏn tơnah, tơlơi khăp đơi kơ tơlơi pơdrŏng sah, laih anŭn tơlơi amoaih kơ mơnơ̆ng pơkŏn mŭt amăng pran jua hăng ket hĭ boh pơhiăp, laih anŭn boh pơhiăp ƀu dưi mơboh ôh. 
And these are they who have been sown on the good ground, such as hear the word and receive it, and bear fruit; one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred [fold]. @ Samơ̆ ƀing mơnuih tŭ mă pơjeh amăng lŏn hiam jing ƀing hmư̆ boh pơhiăp laih anŭn mă tŭ gơ̆, hăng hmâo mơboh sa asar lĕ ƀơi lŏn hiam, jing kar hăng ƀing mơnuih hmư̆ hiăp pơtô, tŭ mă hăng mơboh, sa asar hmâo hĭ klâo pluh, năm pluh, laih anŭn sa rơtuh.”
And he said to them, Does the lamp come that it should be put under the bushel or under the couch? [Is it] not that it should be set upon the lamp-stand? @  Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Hmâo mơ̆ arăng ba apui kơđen pioh gah yŭ kơ kơthŭng, ƀôdah gah yŭ kơ sưng pĭt, samơ̆ ƀu pioh ôh ñu ƀơi gơ̆ng apui kơđen? 
For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest; nor does any secret thing take place, but that it should come to light. @ Yua kơ hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng pơdŏp či pơrơđah hĭ, laih anŭn hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng hơgơ̆m či brơi arăng ƀuh amăng tơlơi bơngač. 
If any one have ears to hear, let him hear. @ Hlơi hmâo tơngia pioh hmư̆, brơi ñu hmư̆ bĕ!”
And he said to them, Take heed what ye hear; with what measure ye mete, it shall be meted to you; and there shall be [more] added to you. @  Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Răng bĕ kơ tơlơi hơgĕt ƀing gih hmư̆. Ơi Adai či pơkă brơi kơ ƀing gih tui hăng hơnơ̆ng ƀing gih hmâo pơkă brơi kơ arăng, laih anŭn či thim brơi kơ ƀing gih dơ̆ng.

And he said, Thus is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast the seed upon the earth, @ Yêsu laĭ dơ̆ng: “Dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai jing kar hăng sa čô mơnuih sai pơjeh ƀơi lŏn. 
and should sleep and rise up night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he does not know how. @ Ñu pĭt ƀôdah mơdưh, mlam ƀôdah tơhrơi, pơjeh čơnăt laih anŭn čăt glong đĭ, samơ̆ mơnuih anŭn ƀu thâo hluh ôh hyư̆m tơlơi anŭn. 
The earth bears fruit of itself, first [the] blade, then an ear, then full corn in the ear. @ Lŏn pô yơh ngă pơjing mơnơ̆ng, blŭng hlâo jing ană pơdai, giơ̆ng anŭn amŭng pơdai laih anŭn dơ̆ng hmâo asar amăng amung anŭn. 
But when the fruit is produced, immediately he sends the sickle, for the harvest is come. @ Samơ̆ tơ pơdai tơsă laih, tañ mơtam pô sai mă mơnek yuă mă hĭ pơdai, yua kơ bơyan hơpuă truh laih”.
And he said, How should we liken the kingdom of God, or with what comparison should we compare it? @ Yêsu laĭ dơ̆ng: “Hăng hơgĕt ta dưi bơkơnar kơ dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai? Ƀôdah hăng tơlơi bơhmutu hơgĕt ƀing ta yua kiăng bơrơđah ñu? 
As to a grain of mustard [seed], which, when it is sown upon the earth, is less than all seeds which are upon the earth, @ Ñu jing kar hăng sa asar pơjeh añăm bơi, tơ arăng sai amăng lŏn, ñu jing anĕt hloh kơ abih bang pơjeh ƀơi lŏn tơnah anai. 
and when it has been sown, mounts up and becomes greater than all herbs, and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven can roost under its shadow. @ Samơ̆ tơ arăng sai ñu laih, ñu čăt laih anŭn jing prŏng hloh kơ abih bang añăm pơtăm pơkŏn, ñu čăt than prŏng, tơl khul čĭm brĭm dưi ngă hruh gah yŭ tơ-u ñu.”
And with many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear, @ Yêsu pơtô boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai kơ gơñu hăng lu tơlơi bơhmutu kar hăng anŭn, tui hăng jua gơñu dưi thâo hluh. 
but without a parable spoke he not to them; and in private he explained all things to his disciples. @ Ñu ƀu pơtô ôh kơ gơñu tơdah ƀu pơhiăp hăng tơlơi bơhmutu, samơ̆ tơdang Ñu dŏ hơjăn hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu, Ñu pơblang brơi abih bang kơ ƀing gơ̆.
And on that day, when evening was come, he says to them, Let us go over to the other side: @ Klam hrơi anŭn, Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Brơi ƀing ta găn nao hang gah adih.” 
and having sent away the crowd, they take him with [them], as he was, in the ship. But other ships also were with him. @ Ƀing ding kơna lui ƀing mơnuih lu anŭn, Yêsu ăt dŏ amăng sŏng. Ƀing ding kơna ba Ñu nao, hmâo lu sŏng pơkŏn ăt nao hrŏm hơbĭt mơ̆n. 
And there comes a violent gust of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it already filled. @ Hmâo rơbŭ kơthel prŏng truh thut, laih anŭn jơlah ia poh yă klă amăng sŏng tơl sŏng bă hăng ia. 
And *he* was in the stern sleeping on the cushion. And they awake him up and say to him, Teacher, dost thou not care that we are perishing? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu dŏ ƀơi klon sŏng, đăl akŏ Ñu ƀơi hơnal akŏ laih anŭn pĭt. Ƀing ding kơna râo Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Ơ Nai, Ih ƀu bơngơ̆t ôh hă kơ ƀing ta či djai?”
And awaking up he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Silence; be mute. And the wind fell, and there was a great calm. @ Yêsu mơdưh, khă angĭn hăng laĭ kơ ia rơsĭ: “Hơđơ̆ng rơiăt bĕ!” Tui anŭn angĭn dŏ krĕt hĭ, laih anŭn ia rơsĭ hơđơ̆ng rơiăt mơtam. 
And he said to them, Why are ye [thus] fearful? how [is it] ye have not faith? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Yua hơgĕt ƀing gih hwĭ? Ƀing gih aka hmâo tơlơi đaŏ ôh hă?”
And they feared [with] great fear, and said one to another, Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? @ Laih anŭn gơñu bă hăng tơlơi hwĭ biă mă laih anŭn bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu: “Hlơi mơnuih anai jing, tơl wơ̆t angĭn hăng ia rơsĭ ăt gưt kơ Ñu mơ̆n?”
And they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes. @ Gơñu truh pơ hang gah adih ia rơsĭ amăng kwar Gêrasen. 
And immediately on his going out of the ship there met him out of the tombs a man possessed by an unclean spirit, @ Tơ Yêsu tơbiă mơ̆ng sŏng, plŭt mơtam hmâo sa čô mơnuih yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak ngă tơbiă mơ̆ng pơsat nao pơ anăp Ñu. 
who had his dwelling in the tombs; and no one was able to bind him, not even with chains; @ Mơnuih anŭn hơdip tơ̆ng krah anih pơsat, laih anŭn arăng ƀu dưi akă ñu ôh, wơ̆t dah hăng hrĕ čuăk arăng kŏn dưi akă kling ñu lơi. 
because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn asunder by him, and the fetters were shattered; and no one was able to subdue him. @ Yua kơ lu wơ̆t laih arăng anŭh tơkai hăng čăp tơngan ñu hăng hrĕ čuăk, samơ̆ ñu wơ̆k joh hĭ anŭh hăng dŭng pơtơĭ hĭ hrĕ čuăk. Ƀu hmâo hlơi hmâo tơlơi kơtang dưi kơ̆ng ñu ôh. 
And continually night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying and cutting himself with stones. @ Hrơi mlam ñu dŏ amăng anih pơ pơsat hăng ƀơi čư̆ ur tơkeč laih anŭn yua boh pơtâo taih rơka, brơ̆p drơi jan ñu pô.
But seeing Jesus from afar off, he ran and did him homage, @ Tơ ñu ƀuh Yêsu mơ̆ng ataih, ñu nao bon kơkuh ƀơi anăp Ñu. 
and crying with a loud voice he says, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure thee by God, torment me not. @ Laih anŭn ñu ur kraih hăng laĭ: “Hơgĕt tơlơi Ih hmâo hăng kâo, Ơ Yêsu Ană Ơi Adai Pô Glông Hloh? Kâo kơwưh kơ Ih hăng anăn Ơi Adai, anăm pơtơnap kâo ôh.” 
For he said to him, Come forth, unclean spirit, out of the man. @ Yua kơ Yêsu hmâo laĭ laih kơ ñu: “Ơ yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak, tơbiă bĕ mơ̆ng mơnuih anai.”
And he asked him, What is thy name? And he says to him, Legion is my name, because we are many. @ Yêsu tơña kơ ñu: “Hlơi anăn ŏng?” Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Anăn kâo jing ‘Ƀing lu,’ yua kơ gơmơi lu biă mă.” 
And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. @ Laih anŭn hăng abih pran jua ñu kơwưh rơkâo kơ Yêsu anăm puh pơđuaĭ hĭ gơñu mơ̆ng čar anŭn.
Now there was there just at the mountain a great herd of swine feeding; @ Hlăk anŭn ƀơi kriăng čư̆ hmâo bơbui lu biă mă dŏ ƀơ̆ng rơ̆k. 
and they besought him, saying, Send us into the swine that we may enter into them. @ Ƀing bơngăt grĭ rơkâo pơđur kơ Yêsu: “Brơi gơmơi nao mŭt amăng khul bơbui anŭn.” 
And Jesus [immediately] allowed them. And the unclean spirits going out entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the steep slope, into the sea (about two thousand), and were choked in the sea. @ Tui anŭn Yêsu brơi gơñu mŭt. Ƀing yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak tơbiă mơ̆ng đah rơkơi anŭn hăng mŭt amăng khul bơbui; Laih anŭn abih bang bơbui anŭn hmâo kơplah wah dua rơbâo drơi, mơ̆ng kriăng čư̆ kơdâo trŭn amăng ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn djai hơngơ̆t amăng ia.
And those that were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had taken place. @ Ƀing wai bơbui đuaĭ kơdŏp hăng ră ruai kơ tơlơi anŭn amăng djŏp plei laih anŭn amăng kwar anŭn. Tui anŭn ƀing ană plei rai lăng hơgĕt tơlơi hmâo truh. 
And they come to Jesus, and they see the possessed of demons sitting [and] clothed and sensible, [him] that had had the legion: and they were afraid. @ Tơ gơñu truh pơ Yêsu, gơñu ƀuh mơnuih hlâo adih yang sat ngă hlăk dŏ ber ƀơi anŭn, buh sum ao laih, tơlơi pơmĭn gơ̆ tơngăl laih; gơñu hwĭ biă mă. 
And they that had seen [it] related to them how it had happened to the [man] possessed by demons, and concerning the swine. @ Hơdôm ƀing ƀuh laih tơlơi truh anŭn ră ruai glaĭ kơ ană plei pla abih tơlơi hmâo truh laih kơ pô yang sat ngă anŭn, wơ̆t tơlơi truh laih kơ khul bơbui. 
And they began to beg him to depart from their coasts. @ Tui anŭn gơñu čơdơ̆ng kơwưh pơđur kơ Yêsu tơbiă mơ̆ng tring gơñu.
And as he went on board ship, the man that had been possessed by demons besought him that he might be with him. @ Tơdang Yêsu čơdơ̆ng đĭ sŏng, mơnuih yang sat ngă anŭn rơkâo pơđur kơ Yêsu kiăng kơ dưi dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu.
And he suffered him not, but says to him, Go to thine home to thine own people, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for thee, and has had mercy on thee. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu hơngah hăng laĭ kơ ñu: “Glaĭ bĕ pơ sang hăng nao bĕ pơ ƀing gơyut gơyâo ih, ră ruai glaĭ kơ gơñu hơdôm tơlơi Khua Yang hmâo ngă brơi laih kơ ih, laih anŭn hyư̆m Ñu hmâo pơrơđah laih tơlơi pap drap kơ ih.”
And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him; and all wondered. @ Tui anŭn ñu glaĭ hăng čơdơ̆ng ră ruai amăng tring Dêkapôlis djŏp mơta tơlơi Yêsu hmâo ngă laih kơ ñu. Laih anŭn abih bang mơnuih hmư̆, leng kơ hling hlang yơh.
And Jesus having passed over in the ship again to the other side, a great crowd gathered to him; and he was by the sea. @ Tơ Yêsu đĭ sŏng dơ̆ng hăng găn pơ hang gah adih, hmâo sa phung mơnuih lu biă mă pơtŭm jum dar Ñu. Ñu dŏ ƀơi hang ia rơsĭ. 
And [behold] there comes one of the rulers of the synagogue, by name Jairus, and seeing him, falls down at his feet; @ Hlăk anŭn, hmâo sa čô amăng ƀing khua wai sang bơjơnum rai, anăn ñu Jairus. Tơ ƀuh Yêsu, ñu bon ƀơi tơkai Ñu, 
and he besought him much, saying, My little daughter is at extremity; [I pray] that thou shouldest come and lay thy hands upon her so that she may be healed, and may live. @ laih anŭn kơwưh pơđur kơ Yêsu hăng abih pran jua: “Ană dra anĕt kâo giăm djai yơh, rơkâo kơ Ih rai hăng ah tơngan ƀơi ñu, tui anŭn gơ̆ či suaih hăng hơdip yơh.”
And he went with him, and a large crowd followed him and pressed on him. @ Tui anŭn Yêsu nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu. Laih anŭn hmâo sa phung mơnuih lu biă mă tui Yêsu, gơñu pơrơsua kơpĭ Ñu.
And a certain woman who had had a flux of blood twelve years, @ Ƀơi anŭn hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi ruă tuh drah hmâo pluh dua thŭn laih. 
and had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent everything she had and had found no advantage from it, but had rather got worse, @ Lu nai ia jrao hmâo pơjrao ñu, laih anŭn ñu hmâo pơrơngiă abih dram gơnam ñu ăt ƀu dưi suaih ôh, samơ̆ tơlơi ruă jai kơtang hloh dơ̆ng. 
having heard concerning Jesus, came in the crowd behind and touched his clothes; @ Ñu hmư̆ hing arăng ră ruai kơ Yêsu, hnŭn yơh ñu rai mŭt amăng phung mơnuih lu hăng tui gah rŏng Yêsu laih anŭn ruaih ao Ñu. 
for she said, If I shall touch but his clothes I shall be healed. @ Yua kơ ñu pơmĭn: “Tơdah kâo kơnơ̆ng ruaih ƀơi ao Ñu đôč kâo či dưi suaih yơh.”
And immediately her fountain of blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was cured from the scourge. @ Tañ mơtam drah ñu khơ̆t hĭ; laih anŭn ñu mưn thâo amăng drơi jan ñu suaih laih. 
And immediately Jesus, knowing in himself the power that had gone out of him, turning round in the crowd said, Who has touched my clothes? @ Yêsu thâo mơtam kơ tơlơi dưi mơyang tơbiă laih mơ̆ng Ñu, tui anŭn yơh Ñu wir glaĭ pơ ƀing mơnuih lu hăng laĭ: “Hlơi hmâo ruaih ao Kâo?”
And his disciples said to him, Thou seest the crowd pressing on thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me? @ Ƀing ding kơna Ñu laĭ hăng Ñu: “Ih ƀuh laih ƀing mơnuih lu pơrơsua kơpĭ Ih, hyư̆m Ih dŏ tơña: ‘Hlơi ruaih Kâo?’”
And he looked round about to see her who had done this. @ Yêsu lăng jum dar kiăng ƀuh hlơi hmâo ngă tơlơi anŭn. 
But the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had taken place in her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth. @ Samơ̆ đah kơmơi thâo laih hơgĕt tơlơi hmâo truh amăng drơi jan ñu, hăng tơlơi hwĭ tơtư̆ ñu rai bon ƀơi tơkai Yêsu, laih anŭn ră ruai abih bang kơ Ñu hăng tơlơi sĭt. 
And he said to her, Daughter, thy faith has healed thee; go in peace, and be well of thy scourge. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Ơ ană đah kơmơi Kâo, tơlơi đaŏ ih hmâo pơsuaih ih laih. Nao bĕ hăng tơlơi rơnŭk rơnua hăng suaih bĕ tơlơi ruă ih.”
While he was yet speaking, they come from the ruler of the synagogue's [house], saying, Thy daughter has died, why troublest thou the teacher any further? @ Tơdang Yêsu ăt dŏ pơhiăp, hmâo hơdôm čô mơnuih mơ̆ng sang Jairus rai laĭ hăng gơ̆: “Ană đah kơmơi ih djai laih, hơgĕt yom ngă pơgleh Nai dơ̆ng?”
But Jesus [immediately], having heard the word spoken, says to the ruler of the synagogue, Fear not; only believe. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu ƀu bơngơ̆t ôh kơ tơlơi gơñu laĭ, laih anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ khua wai sang bơjơnum: “Anăm hwĭ ôh, kơnơ̆ng đaŏ đôč.” 
And he suffered no one to accompany him save Peter and James, and John the brother of James. @ Laih anŭn Ñu ƀu brơi ôh hlơi tui hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu, kơnơ̆ng Pêtrôs, Yakơ, laih anŭn Yôhan adơi Yakơ đôč. 
And he comes to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and sees the tumult, and people weeping and wailing greatly. @ Tơ gơñu truh pơ sang khua wai sang bơjơnum anŭn, Yêsu ƀuh tơlơi pơrơông pơrơang, laih anŭn ƀing ană plei hia hăng čok ur kraih. 
And entering in he says to them, Why do ye make a tumult and weep? the child has not died, but sleeps. @ Yêsu mŭt amăng sang anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu: “Yua hơgĕt ƀing gih ngă pơrơông pơrơang hăng čŏk hia lĕ? Čơđai anĕt anai ƀu djai ôh, samơ̆ gơ̆ dŏ pĭt.”
And they derided him. But he, having put [them] all out, takes with [him] the father of the child, and the mother, and those that were with him, and enters in where the child was lying. @ Laih anŭn ƀing anŭn klao mưč kơ Yêsu.

And having laid hold of the hand of the child, he says to her, Talitha koumi, which is, interpreted, Damsel, I say to thee, Arise. @ Yêsu mă tơngan ñu hăng laĭ kơ gơ̆, “Talitha kum”  kiăng laĭ “Ơ dra anĕt, Kâo pơđar kơ ih, tơgŭ bĕ!”
And immediately the damsel arose and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with great astonishment. @ Tañ mơtam đah kơmơi anĕt anŭn tơgŭ hăng rơbat nao; yua kơ gơ̆ hmâo pluh dua thŭn laih. Abih bang mơnuih leng kơtuă biă mă.

And when sabbath was come he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing were amazed, saying, Whence [has] this [man] these things? and what [is] the wisdom that is given to him, and such works of power are done by his hands? @ Ƀơi hrơi saƀat Ñu čơdơ̆ng pơtô amăng sang bơjơnum, lu ƀing dŏ hmư̆ Ñu kơtuă hling hăng laĭ: “Mơ̆ng pă Pô anai hmâo hơdôm tơlơi anai?

And they went forth and preached that they should repent; @ Hnŭn yơh gơñu tơbiă nao, hyu pơtô kiăng kơ abih bang mơnuih khŏm kơhmal tơlơi soh.

And Herod the king heard [of him] (for his name had become public), and said, John the baptist is risen from among [the] dead, and on this account works of power are wrought by him. @  Pơtao Hêrôt hmư̆ hing arăng ruai kơ Yêsu, yua kơ lu mơnuih hmâo hmư̆ hing laih anăn Yêsu.

For the same Herod had sent and seized John, and had bound him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her. @ Yua kơ Hêrôt pô hmâo pơkiaŏ nao arăng mă čăp Yôhan hăng krư̆ hĭ amăng sang mơnă yua kơ HʼHêrôđias, bơnai Philip adơi Hêrôt; Hêrôt hmâo mă đah kơmơi anŭn jing hĭ bơnai ñu.

But Herodias kept it [in her mind] against him, and wished to kill him, and could not: @ Hnŭn yơh HʼHêrôđias hil rơañ kơ Yôhan laih anŭn kiăng pơdjai hĭ gơ̆. Samơ̆ ñu ƀu dưi pơdjai ôh, 
for Herod feared John knowing that he was a just and holy man, and kept him safe; and having heard him, did many things, and heard him gladly. @ yua kơ Hêrôt hwĭ kơ Yôhan, thâo ñu jing sa čô mơnuih tơpă hăng rơgoh hiam, tui anŭn yơh ñu pơgang gơ̆ ƀu brơi arăng pơdjai ôh.

And a holiday being come, when Herod, on his birthday, made a supper to his grandees, and to the chiliarchs, and the chief [men] of Galilee; @ Samơ̆ hmâo mông gal truh ƀơi hrơi pơhơdơr kơ tơlơi tơkeng kơ ñu, Hêrôt pơkra tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă kơ ƀing khua wai lăng, ƀing khua tơhan hăng ƀing mơnuih khua pơprŏng amăng čar Galilê. 
and the daughter of the same Herodias having come in, and danced, pleased Herod and those that were with [him] at table; and the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and I will give it thee. @ Yua kơ, tơ ană dra HʼHêrôđias mŭt suang ñu ngă bơmơak kơ Hêrôt hăng kơ ƀing ñu jak.

And she went out, and said to her mother, What should I ask? And she said, The head of John the baptist. @ Đah kơmơi dra anŭn tơbiă nao hăng tơña kơ amĭ ñu: “Hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng kâo či rơkâo?”

And immediately going in with haste to the king, she asked saying, I desire that thou give me directly upon a dish the head of John the baptist. @ Tañ mơtam, đah kơmơi dra anŭn mŭt glaĭ hăng tơlơi hăt nao ƀơi anăp pơtao laih anŭn rơkâo tui anai: “Kâo kiăng ih brơi kơ kâo akŏ Yôhan Ƀatem pioh amăng jam ră anai mơtam.”
And the king, [while] made very sorry, on account of the oaths and those lying at table with [him] would not break his word with her. @ Pơtao ruă rơngot biă mă; samơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi ñu ƀuăn rơ̆ng laih, laih anŭn yua kơ ƀing mơnuih ñu jak iâu, ñu ƀu kiăng hơngah hĭ ôh tơlơi ñu hmâo ƀuăn laih kơ dra anŭn. 
And immediately the king, having sent one of the guard, ordered his head to be brought. And he went out and beheaded him in the prison, @ Pơtao pơkiaŏ nao mơtam sa čô tơhan gak hăng pơtă kơ ñu mă ba rai akŏ Yôhan. Tơhan anŭn nao amăng sang mơnă hăng čơ̆ng hĭ tơkuai Yôhan.

And the apostles are gathered together to Jesus. And they related to him all things, [both] what they had done and what they had taught. @ Ƀing khua ding kơna pơƀŭt glaĭ jum dar Yêsu, hăng ruai glaĭ kơ ñu abih bang bruă gơñu hmâo ngă hăng abih tơlơi gơñu hmâo pơtô laih. 
And he said to them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a little. For those coming and those going were many, and they had not leisure even to eat. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Nao bĕ pơ tơdrŏn tač, hăng dŏ pơdơi ƀiă.” Yua kơ hmâo lu mơnuih nao rai tơl gơñu ƀu wăn ƀơ̆ng huă ôh. 
And they went away apart into a desert place by ship. @ Laih anŭn gơñu đĭ sŏng nao pơ tơdrŏn tač dŏ hơjăn ƀing gơñu.
And many saw them going, and recognised them, and ran together there on foot, out of all the cities, and got [there] before them. @ Hlăk anŭn hmâo lu mơnuih ƀuh gơñu nao hăng thâo krăn gơñu, tui anŭn gơñu mơ̆ng abih bang plei nao laih anŭn truh hlâo kơ gơñu. 
And on leaving [the ship] [Jesus] saw a great crowd, and he was moved with compassion for them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. @ Tơ Yêsu đĭ pơ hang Ñu ƀuh sa phung mơnuih lu lĭn, laih anŭn Ñu glưh pran jua pap, yua kơ gơñu jing kar hăng triu ƀu hmâo pô wai ôh; laih anŭn Ñu čơdơ̆ng pơtô kơ ƀing gơ̆ lu mơta tơlơi. 
And when it was already late in the day, his disciples coming to him say, The place is desert, and it is already late in the day; @ Tơ adai klam laih, ƀing ding kơna Ñu nao laĭ hăng Yêsu: “Anai jing anih rơnguă rơnguăn, laih anŭn adai klam laih;

And he answering said to them, Give *ye* them to eat. And they say to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give them to eat? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih yơh brơi mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă kơ gơñu.” Gơñu laĭ hăng Yêsu: “Hyư̆m, ƀing gơmơi khŏm nao blơi ƀañ tơpŭng truh kơ dua rơtuh đơniê hăng brơi gơñu ƀơ̆ng hă?”
And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? Go [and] see. And when they knew they say, Five, and two fishes. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Nao lăng bĕ, hơdôm boh ƀañ tơpŭng ƀing gih hmâo?” Tơ gơñu nao lăng laih, gơñu laĭ: “Rơma boh ƀañ tơpŭng hăng dua drơi akan.”
And he ordered them to make them all sit down by companies on the green grass. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu pơtă ƀing ding kơna Ñu brơi abih bang ƀing mơnuih lu dŏ ber ƀơi rơ̆k mơda. 
And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties. @ Tui anŭn gơñu dŏ ber tui khul, hmâo khul sa rơtuh čô, hmâo khul rơma pluh čô. 
And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave [them] to his disciples that they might set [them] before them. And the two fishes he divided among all. @ Yêsu mă rơma boh ƀañ tơpŭng hăng dua drơi akan, Ñu angak đĭ mơta pơ adai, hăng bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai, laih anŭn wơ̆k hĭ ƀañ tơpŭng hăng brơi kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu pơpha brơi kơ ƀing mơnuih lu.

And they all ate and were satisfied. @ Abih bang gơñu ƀơ̆ng leng kơ trơi soh sel. 
And they took up of fragments the fillings of twelve hand-baskets, and of the fishes. @ Laih anŭn gơñu duñ mă ƀañ tơpŭng hăng akan bă pluh dua bai. 
And those that ate of the loaves were five thousand men. @ Mrô ƀing ƀơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng anŭn hmâo rơma rơbâo čô đah rơkơi.
And immediately he compelled his disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before to the other side to Bethsaida, while *he* sends the crowd away. @ Laih anŭn mơtam Yêsu brơi ƀing ding kơna Ñu đĭ sŏng găn nao hang gah adih anăp nao pơ plei Bêtsaida hlâo kơ Ñu, tơdang Ñu brơi ƀing mơnuih lu glaĭ. 
And, having dismissed them, he departed into the mountain to pray. @ Giơ̆ng kơ Ñu hmâo laĭ nao hiam kơ ƀing mơnuih lu anŭn, Ñu đĭ pơ čư̆ kiăng iâu laĭ. 
And when evening was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and *he* alone upon the land. @ Tơ mơmŏt truh, sŏng anŭn dŏ tơ̆ng krah ia rơsĭ laih, samơ̆ Yêsu ăt dŏ hơjăn Ñu pơ kơdư. 
And seeing them labouring in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them, about the fourth watch of the night he comes to them walking on the sea, and would have passed them by. @ Yêsu ƀuh ƀing ding kơna Ñu waih sŏng hăng tơlơi tơnap gleh, yua kơ angĭn thut klă pă anăp gơñu.

But they, seeing him walking on the sea, thought that it was an apparition, and cried out. @ Samơ̆ tơ gơñu ƀuh Yêsu rơbat ƀơi ngŏ jơlah ia, gơñu pơmĭn dah atâo hnŭn yơh gơñu ur kraih;

And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind fell. And they were exceedingly beyond measure astonished in themselves and wondered; @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Ñu đĭ amăng sŏng hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing gơñu, laih anŭn angĭn rơiăt hĭ. Gơñu kơtuă hling hlang hloh dơ̆ng,

And on their coming out of the ship, immediately recognising him, @ Tơ gơñu tơbiă mơ̆ng sŏng, ƀing ană plei thâo krăn mơtam Yêsu,

And wherever he entered into villages, or cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the market-places, and besought him that they might touch if it were only the hem of his garment; and as many as touched him were healed. @ Pơpă anih Yêsu nao, amăng plei anĕt, plei prŏng, ƀôdah ƀơi gah rơngiao plei, arăng pioh ƀing duăm ruă amăng anih sang sĭ mia, laih anŭn gơñu rơkâo kơwưh kơ Yêsu brơi gơñu ƀiă hloh dưi ruaih kơnơ̆ng ƀơi jih ao Ñu đôč.

But he answering said to them, Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Êsai laĭ lui hlâo kơ ƀing gih jing ƀing plơ̆m ƀlor djơ̆ biă mă yơh, kar hăng tơlơi hmâo čih laih:

And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right. @ Tañ mơtam tơngia ñu pŏk hĭ, jơlah ñu klaih, laih anŭn ñu čơdơ̆ng pơhiăp klă rơđah. 
And he charged them that they should speak to no one [of it]. But so much the more *he* charged them, so much the more abundantly *they* proclaimed it; @ Tui anŭn Yêsu pơtă kơ ƀing anŭn anăm ră ruai kơ arăng ôh, samơ̆ jai Yêsu khă jai hloh dơ̆ng gơñu ră ruai tơlơi anŭn. 
and they were astonished above measure, saying, He does all things well; he makes both the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak. @ Ƀing anŭn dŏ kơtuă hling biă mă hăng laĭ “Ñu ngă abih bang bruă hiam soh sel. Ñu ngă brơi wơ̆t mơnuih tơngil dưi hmư̆ laih anŭn mơnuih kơmlô thâo pơhiăp.”
In those days, there being again a great crowd, and they having nothing that they could eat, having called his disciples to [him], he says to them, @ Amăng hơdôm hrơi anŭn, sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng ƀing mơnuih lu pơtŭm glaĭ, laih anŭn gơñu ƀu hmâo mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă ôh, Yêsu iâu ƀing ding kơna Ñu rai pơ Ñu hăng laĭ kơ gơñu, 
I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, @ “Kâo pap kơ ƀing mơnuih lu anai, yua kơ gơñu hmâo dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Kâo klâo hrơi laih, laih anŭn ƀu hmâo mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă ôh. 
and if I should dismiss them to their home fasting, they will faint on the way; for some of them are come from far. @ Tơdah Kâo brơi gơñu glaĭ hăng tơlơi rơpa, gơñu či rơwet rŏk jơlan; yua kơ hmâo đơđa amăng ƀing gơñu rai mơ̆ng ataih.”
And his disciples answered him, Whence shall one be able to satisfy these with bread here in a desert place? @ Ƀing ding kơna Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Amăng tơdrŏn tač anai hyư̆m dưi hmâo ƀañ tơpŭng čem ƀing anai lĕ?”
And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven. @ Yêsu tơña kơ gơñu: “Hơdôm klŏ ƀañ tơpŭng ƀing gih hmâo?” Gơñu laĭ: “Tơjuh klŏ.”
And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. And having taken the seven loaves, he gave thanks, and broke [them] and gave [them] to his disciples, that they might set [them] before [them]; and they set [them] before the crowd. @ Yêsu pơtă brơi ƀing mơnuih lu dŏ ber ƀơi lŏn.

And they had a few small fishes, and having blessed them, he desired these also to be set before [them]. @ Gơñu ăt hmâo mơ̆n ƀơƀiă drơi akan anĕt, laih bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai, kar kaĭ mơ̆n Ñu pơtă kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu pơpha brơi akan anŭn kơ ƀing mơnuih lu. 
And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up of fragments that remained seven baskets. @ Abih bang mơnuih ƀơ̆ng trơi soh sel, laih anŭn gơñu duñ djah dŏ glaĭ bă tơjuh bai. 
And they [that had eaten] were about four thousand; and he sent them away. @ Ƀing ƀơ̆ng anŭn hmâo giăm pă rơbâo čô. Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu brơi ƀing mơnuih glaĭ,

And the Pharisees went out and began to dispute against him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, tempting him. @  Ƀing Pharisi rai laih anŭn pơrơjah hăng Yêsu. Gơñu rơkâo Yêsu ngă sa gru kơnăl mơyang mơ̆ng adai kiăng lông lăng Ñu. 
And groaning in his spirit, he says, Why does this generation seek a sign? Verily I say unto you, A sign shall in no wise be given to this generation. @ Yêsu kơhôih amăng bơngăt jua hăng laĭ: “Yua hơgĕt ƀing mơnuih rơnŭk anai hơduah sa gru kơnăl mơyang?

And he left them, and going again on board ship, went away to the other side. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu lui gơñu, wơ̆t glaĭ đĭ sŏng hăng găn nao pơ hang gah adih.
And they forgot to take bread, and save one loaf, they had not [any] with them in the ship. @ Ƀing ding kơna wơr bĭt djă ba ƀañ tơpŭng; amăng sŏng gơñu kơnơ̆ng hmâo sa klŏ ƀañ tơpŭng đôč. 
And he charged them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and [of] the leaven of Herod. @ Yêsu pơtă kơ gơñu hăng laĭ: “Răng bĕ kơ tơpơi ƀing Pharisi hăng tơpơi Hêrôt.”
And they reasoned with one another, [saying], It is because we have no bread. @ Gơñu črŏng sai tơdruă gơñu kơ tơlơi anŭn hăng laĭ: “Ñu pơhiăp tui anŭn yua kơ ƀing ta ƀu hmâo djă ƀañ tơpŭng ôh.”
And Jesus knowing [it], says to them, Why reason ye because ye have no bread? Do ye not yet perceive nor understand? Have ye your heart [yet] hardened? @ Yêsu thâo tơlơi anŭn hăng laĭ kơ gơñu: “Hyư̆m ƀing gih črŏng sai kơ tơlơi ƀing gih ƀu hmâo ƀañ tơpŭng lĕ? Ƀing gih aka thâo hăng aka hluh ôh hă?

And when the seven for the four thousand, the filling of how many baskets of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven. @ “Laih anŭn tơjuh klŏ ƀañ tơpŭng brơi kơ pă rơbâo čô mơnuih, ƀing gih duñ glaĭ hơdôm bai čơđeh meh ƀañ rơbeh?” Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơjuh bai.”
And he said to them, How do ye not yet understand? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih ăt aka thâo hluh ôh hă?”
And he comes to Bethsaida; and they bring him a blind man, and beseech him that he might touch him. @ Laih anŭn gơñu truh pơ plei Bêtsaida. Arăng ba rai pơ Yêsu sa čô đah rơkơi bum mơta, hăng rơkâo kơwưh kơ Yêsu ruaih gơ̆. 
And taking hold of the hand of the blind man he led him forth out of the village, and having spit upon his eyes, he laid his hands upon him, and asked him if he beheld anything. @ Yêsu djă tơngan pô bum anŭn, ba gơ̆ pơ gah rơngiao plei.

And having looked up, he said, I behold men, for I see [them], as trees, walking. @ Gơ̆ angak lăng hăng laĭ: “Kâo ƀuh mơnuih, samơ̆ gơñu kar hăng phŭn kơyâo hlăk dŏ rơbat.”
Then he laid his hands again upon his eyes, and he saw distinctly, and was restored and saw all things clearly. @ Sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng Yêsu ah tơngan Ñu ƀơi mơta gơ̆, laih anŭn gơ̆ lăng ƀu kơ ƀleh ôh laih anŭn gơ̆ hlao mơtam hăng ƀuh klă rơđah abih bang mơnơ̆ng. 
And he sent him to his house, saying, Neither enter into the village, nor tell [it] to any one in the village. @ Yêsu brơi gơ̆ glaĭ pơ sang hăng pơtă: “Anăm mŭt glaĭ ôh amăng plei.”
And Jesus went forth and his disciples, into the villages of Caesarea-Philippi. And by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am? @ Yêsu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu đuaĭ mơ̆ng anŭn, laih anŭn nao pơ lu boh plei amăng tring Sêsarê Philip.

And they answered him, saying, John the baptist; and others, Elias; but others, One of the prophets. @  Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Yôhan Ƀatem, laih anŭn ƀing pơkŏn laĭ Êli, ƀing pơkŏn dơ̆ng laĭ sa čô amăng ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo.”
And he asked them, But *ye*, who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering says to him, *Thou* art the Christ. @  Yêsu tơña kơ ƀing gơ̆: “Samơ̆ ƀing gih laĭ hlơi Kâo jing?”
Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ kơ Ñu: “Ih jing Yang Krist.”
And he charged them straitly, in order that they should tell no man about him. @ Laih anŭn Khua Yang Yêsu khă kơtang tĭt kơ ƀing gơñu, anăm pơhaih kơ arăng ôh hlơi Ñu jing.
And he began to teach them that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and of the scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise [again]. @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu čơdơ̆ng pơtô kơ gơñu tơlơi Ană Mơnuih khŏm tŭ lu tơlơi ruă nuă, laih anŭn ƀing kŏng tha, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt či hơngah lui Ñu, hăng pơdjai hĭ Ñu, laih anŭn klâo hrơi tơdơi Ñu či hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng. 
And he spoke the thing openly. And Peter, taking him to [him], began to rebuke him. @ Yêsu laĭ tơlơi anŭn klă rơđah biă mă. Pêtrôs ba Yêsu pơ anih pơkŏn hăng khă kơ Ñu anăm laĭ tui anŭn ôh. 
But he, turning round and seeing his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Get away behind me, Satan, for thy mind is not on the things that are of God, but on the things that are of men. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu wir lăng kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu, hăng ƀuah Pêtrôs: “Ơ Satan, kơdŭn bĕ gah klon Kâo.

And having called the crowd with his disciples, he said to them, Whoever desires to come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me. @  Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu iâu ƀing mơnuih lu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu laih anŭn laĭ: “Tơdah hlơi pô kiăng đuaĭ tui Kâo brơi ñu khŏm hơngah hĭ tơlơi pô ñu kiăng, glăm kơyâo bơrơkal ñu pô, hăng đuaĭ tui Kâo.

And he said to them, Verily I say unto you, There are some of those standing here that shall not taste death until they shall have seen the kingdom of God come in power. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ hăng gơñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hmâo đơđa ƀing dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anai ƀu či djai ôh hlâo kơ gơñu ƀuh dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai rai hăng tơlơi dưi mơyang.”
And after six days Jesus takes with [him] Peter and James and John, and takes them up on a high mountain by themselves apart. And he was transfigured before them: @  Năm hrơi tơdơi Yêsu ba Pêtrôs, Yakơ, hăng Yôhan đĭ pơ glong čŏng čư̆ hơjăn gơñu. Laih anŭn drơi jan Yêsu hrih ƀơi anăp gơñu. 
and his garments became shining, exceeding white [as snow], such as fuller on earth could not whiten [them]. @ Sum ao Ñu rơđah jing kơmlă hăng kŏ biă mă, kŏ hloh kơ arăng dưi ngă ƀơi lŏn tơnah anai. 
And there appeared to them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. @ Plŭt Êli hăng Môis pơƀuh rai. Dua čô anŭn dŏ pơhiăp hrŏm hăng Yêsu. 
And Peter answering says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good that we should be here; and let us make three tabernacles, for thee one, and for Moses one, and for Elias one. @ Pêtrôs laĭ hăng Yêsu. “Ơ Nai hiam yơh ƀing ta dŏ pơ anai, brơi ƀing ta ngă klâo boh sang khăn, sa boh kơ Ih, sa boh kơ Môis, hăng sa boh kơ Êli.” 
For he knew not what he should say, for they were filled with fear. @ Yua kơ Pêtrôs ƀu thâo či pơhiăp hơgĕt ôh, yua kơ gơñu hwĭ biă mă.
And there came a cloud overshadowing them, and there came a voice out of the cloud, *This* is my beloved Son: hear him. @  Giơ̆ng anŭn hmâo sa ƀŭt kơthul gom gơñu, laih anŭn hmâo asăp pơhiăp mơ̆ng kơthul anŭn: “Anai yơh jing Ană Kâo, Pô Kâo khăp hơeng biă mă. Brơi ƀing gih hmư̆ hiăp Ñu bĕ.” 
And suddenly having looked around, they no longer saw any one, but Jesus alone with themselves. @ Tô̆ kơ thĕng, tơ ƀing ding kơna lăng jum dar, gơñu ƀu ƀuh hlơi dơ̆ng ôh hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu, kơnơ̆ng hơjăn Yêsu đôč.
And as they descended from the mountain, he charged them that they should relate to no one what they had seen, unless when the Son of man should be risen from among [the] dead. @ Tơdang gơñu trŭn mơ̆ng čư̆, Yêsu pơtă kơ ƀing gơñu anăm ră ruai kơ arăng ôh kơ tơlơi gơñu hmâo ƀuh laih tơl Ană Mơnuih hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng ƀing djai.
And they kept that saying, questioning among themselves, what rising from among [the] dead was. @ Tui anŭn gơñu djă pioh tơlơi anŭn laih anŭn tơña tơdruă gơñu: “hơgĕt kiăng laĭ: ‘tơlơi hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng ƀing djai?’” 
And they asked him saying, Why do the scribes say that Elias must first have come? @ Gơñu tơña kơ Yêsu: “Hyư̆m ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt laĭ, Êli khŏm rai hlâo?”
And he answering said to them, Elias indeed, having first come, restores all things; and how is it written of the Son of man that he must suffer much, and be set at nought: @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Sĭt biă mă Êli khŏm rai hlâo kiăng pơkra glaĭ abih bang bruă.

And when he came to the disciples he saw a great crowd around them, and scribes disputing against them. @ Tơ gơñu truh pơ ƀing ding kơna pơkŏn, gơñu ƀuh phung mơnuih lu biă mă dŏ jum dar gơñu, laih anŭn hmâo hơdôm čô nai pơtô tơlơi juăt dŏ pơrơjah hăng gơñu.

And he asked them, What do ye question with them about? @ Yêsu tơña kơ gơñu: “Tơlơi hơgĕt ƀing gih pơrơjah hăng gơñu?”
And one out of the crowd answered him, Teacher, I brought to thee my son, who has a dumb spirit; @ Sa čô amăng phung mơnuih lu anŭn laĭ glaĭ kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, kâo ba rai ană đah rơkơi kâo pơ Ih, yua kơ hmâo yang sat ngă kơ ñu jing kơmlô. 
and wheresoever it seizes him it tears him, and he foams and gnashes his teeth, and he is withering away. And I spoke to thy disciples, that they might cast him out, and they could not. @ Rĭm wơ̆t yang ngă ñu, ñu pơrơbuh gơ̆ pơ lŏn, ƀlĕ pơrơboh ia bah, kĕ tơgơi laih anŭn drơi jan gơ̆ khăng arăng hĭ.

But he answering them says, O unbelieving generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ kơnŭng djuai ƀu hmâo tơlơi đaŏ, hơdôm sui dơ̆ng Kâo khŏm dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing gih?

And they brought him to him. And seeing him the spirit immediately tore him; and falling upon the earth he rolled foaming. @ Laih anŭn gơñu ba čơđai anĕt anŭn pơ Yêsu; tơ yang sat ƀuh Yêsu, ñu prăh rơbuh čơđai anŭn ƀơi lŏn mơtam, tơglung blư̆ nao rai, blôk ia bah. 
And he asked his father, How long a time is it that it has been like this with him? And he said, From childhood; @ Yêsu tơña kơ ama ñu: “Hơbin ñu hmâo laih tơlơi anŭn?” Ñu laĭ: “Čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng gơ̆ hlăk dŏ anĕt.
and often it has cast him both into fire and into waters that it might destroy him: but if thou couldst [do] anything, be moved with pity on us, and help us. @ Lu wơ̆t yang sat glŏm gơ̆ amăng apui ƀôdah amăng ia kiăng pơdjai gơ̆. Samơ̆ tơdah hơgĕt Ih dưi ngă, rơkâo kơ Ih pap hăng djru gơmơi đa.”
And Jesus said to him, The 'if thou couldst' is [if thou couldst] believe: all things are possible to him that believes. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Hyư̆m ih laĭ: ‘Tơdah Ih dưi’ Abih bang tơlơi dưi soh sel kơ hlơi pô đaŏ.”
And immediately the father of the young child crying out said [with tears], I believe, help mine unbelief. @ Tañ mơtam ama čơđai anŭn ur laĭ: “Kâo đaŏ, rơkâo ih djru brơi tơlơi kâo ƀu đaŏ!”
But Jesus, seeing that [the] crowd was running up together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, *I* command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him. @ Tơ Yêsu ƀuh ƀing mơnuih lu rai, Ñu ƀuah, laĭ kơ yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak anŭn: “Ơ yang kơmlô hăng tơngil, Kâo pơtă kơ ŏng tơbiă bĕ mơ̆ng čơđai anĕt anai, laih anŭn anăm glaĭ mŭt amăng gơ̆ dơ̆ng ôh.”
And having cried out and torn [him] much, he came out; and he became as if dead, so that the most said, He is dead. @ Giơ̆ng kơ yang sat ur laih anŭn ñu pơañak drơi jan gơ̆ kơtang biă mă hăng tơbiă hĭ. Čơđai anŭn jing kar hăng sa čô djai yơh, tơl hmâo lu mơnuih amăng ƀing anŭn laĭ: “Gơ̆ djai yơh!” 
But Jesus, having taken hold of him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu mă tơngan ñu hăng rŭ đĭ, laih anŭn gơ̆ tơgŭ.
And when he was entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Wherefore could not *we* cast him out? @ Tơ Yêsu mŭt sang, ƀing ding kơna tơña kơ Ñu tơdang Ñu dŏ hơjăn: “Yua hơgĕt ƀing gơmơi ƀu dưi puh pơđuaĭ ôh yang sat anŭn?”
And he said to them, This kind can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Tơdah ƀu iâu laĭ ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi puh pơđuaĭ mơta yang sat anŭn ôh.”
And going forth from thence they went through Galilee; and he would not that any one knew it; @ Mơ̆ng anih anŭn gơñu hlŏng nao găn kwar Galilê, Yêsu ƀu kiăng arăng thâo tơlơi anŭn ôh, 
for he taught his disciples and said to them, The Son of man is delivered into men's hands, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, after three days he shall rise again. @ yua kơ Ñu hmâo pơtô kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu tơdang laĭ kơ ƀing gơ̆: “Arăng či jao lui Ană Mơnuih amăng tơngan mơnuih, laih anŭn gơñu či pơdjai hĭ Ñu; laih arăng pơdjai, hrơi tal klâo Ñu či hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng.”
But they understood not the saying, and feared to ask him. @ Samơ̆ ƀing gơñu ƀu thâo hluh ôh kơ tơlơi Yêsu hmâo pơhiăp anŭn, laih anŭn dơ̆ng gơñu hwĭ ƀu khĭn tơña Yêsu ôh.

And taking a little child he set it in their midst, and having taken it in his arms he said to them, @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu mă sa čô čơđai anĕt pioh gơ̆ ƀơi tơ̆ng krah ƀing gơñu. Ñu pi gơ̆ tơdang laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu. 
Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, does not receive me, but him who sent me. @ “Hlơi jum sa čô čơđai anĕt kar hăng anai amăng anăn Kâo kar hăng ñu jum Kâo mơ̆n; laih anŭn hlơi jum Kâo, ƀu djơ̆ jum Kâo ôh, samơ̆ jum Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo.”
And John answered him saying, Teacher, we saw some one casting out demons in thy name, who does not follow us, and we forbad him, because he does not follow us. @ Yôhan laĭ hăng Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, gơmơi hmâo ƀuh sa čô mơnuih puh pơđuaĭ yang sat amăng anăn Ih, laih anŭn gơmơi khă ñu yua kơ ñu ƀu tui hăng ƀing ta ôh.”
But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no one who shall do a miracle in my name, and be able soon [after] to speak ill of me; @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ: “Anăm khă ñu ôh, yua kơ ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô mơnuih ngă bruă mơsêh mơyang amăng anăn Kâo mơ̆n laih anŭn pơhiăp sat kơ Kâo mơ̆n.

And whosoever shall be a snare to one of the little ones who believe [in me], it were better for him if a millstone were hung about his neck, and he cast into the sea. @ “Tơdah hlơi ngă brơi sa čô amăng ƀing čơđai anĕt anai hmâo đaŏ laih Kâo lĕ amăng tơlơi soh, hiam hloh brơi arăng akă hĭ sa boh rơsŭng boh pơtâo prŏng ƀơi tơkuai pô anŭn hăng glŏm hĭ ñu amăng ia rơsĭ.

And rising up thence he comes into the coasts of Judaea, and the other side of the Jordan. And again crowds come together to him, and, as he was accustomed, again he taught them. @ Yêsu đuaĭ mơ̆ng anŭn nao pơ tring Yuđa laih anŭn pơ hang gah adih ia krong Yurdan.

And Pharisees coming to [him] asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away [his] wife? (tempting him). @ Hmâo ƀing Pharisi nao pơ Yêsu hăng tơña kiăng lông lăng Ñu: “Phiăn mơ̆ sa čô đah rơkơi klaih lui bơnai ñu?”
But he answering said to them, What did Moses command you? @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ gơñu: “Hơgĕt Môis hmâo pơtă laih kơ ƀing gih?”
And they said, Moses allowed to write a bill of divorce, and to put away. @  Gơñu laĭ: “Môis brơi tơlơi dưi đah rơkơi čih hră klaih lui laih anŭn lui hĭ bơnai ñu.”
And Jesus answering said to them, In view of your hard-heartedness he wrote this commandment for you; @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Yua kơ pran jua ƀing gih khăng, hnŭn yơh ñu čih tơlơi juăt anŭn brơi kơ ƀing gih.

What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. @ Tui anŭn, anăm brơi mơnuih pơčơlah hĭ ôh ƀing hlơi Ơi Adai hmâo pơgop laih.”
And again in the house the disciples asked him concerning this. @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ amăng sang, ƀing ding kơna tơña kơ Yêsu dơ̆ng kơ tơlơi anŭn. 
And he says to them, Whosoever shall put away his wife and shall marry another, commits adultery against her. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Hlơi lui bơnai ñu hăng dŏ bơnai pơkŏn, jing ñu ngă tơlơi klĕ pyu soh hăng bơnai ñu. 
And if a woman put away her husband and shall marry another, she commits adultery. @ Laih anŭn tơdah đah kơmơi lui rơkơi ñu dŏ rơkơi pơkŏn, ăt ñu jing soh klĕ pyu mơ̆n.”
And they brought little children to him that he might touch them. But the disciples rebuked those that brought [them]. @ Arăng ba ƀing čơđai anĕt nao pơ Yêsu kiăng kơ Ñu ah tơngan hơ-ŭ mơyun kơ ƀing gơ̆; samơ̆ ƀing ding kơna ƀuah kơ ƀing ba čơđai anŭn. 
But Jesus seeing [it], was indignant, and said to them, Suffer the little children to come to me; forbid them not; for of such is the kingdom of God. @ Samơ̆ tơ Yêsu ƀuh tơlơi anŭn Ñu hil hăng laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Brơi ƀing čơđai rai pơ Kâo bĕ, anăm khă ƀing gơñu ôh, yua kơ dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai lơ̆m kơ hlơi pô jing kar hăng ƀing čơđai anŭn.

And as he went forth into the way, a person ran up to [him], and kneeling to him asked him, Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life? @ Tơdang Yêsu čơdơ̆ng rơbat nao, hmâo sa čô mơnuih nao čon tơŭt ƀơi anăp Ñu hăng tơña kơ Ñu: “Ơ Nai hiam klă, hơgĕt tơlơi kâo khŏm ngă kiăng dưi mă tŭ tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar?”
But Jesus said to him, Why callest thou me good? no one is good but one, [that is] God. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Yua hơgĕt ih iâu Kâo jing Pô hiam klă lĕ? Ƀu hmâo hlơi hiam klă ôh, kơnơ̆ng hơjăn Ơi Adai đôč.

And he answering said to him, Teacher, all these things have I kept from my youth. @ Gơ̆ laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Nai, kâo hmâo tui gưt laih abih bang tơlơi juăt anŭn čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng kâo dŏ čơđai.”
And Jesus looking upon him loved him, and said to him, One thing lackest thou: go, sell whatever thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me, [taking up the cross]. @ Yêsu lăng kơ gơ̆ hăng tơlơi khăp, laih anŭn laĭ: “Ih kơƀah sa tơlơi; nao bĕ, sĭ hĭ hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng ih hmâo hăng pha brơi kơ ƀing ƀun rin, laih anŭn ih či hmâo yơh kong ngăn yom amăng adai.

And Jesus looking around says to his disciples, How difficultly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! @ Tui anŭn Yêsu lăng jum dar hăng laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Tơnap biă mă kơ ƀing pơdrŏng sah mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai!”
And the disciples were amazed at his words. And Jesus again answering says to them, Children, how difficult it is that those who trust in riches should enter into the kingdom of God! @ Ƀing ding kơna kơtuă kơ tơlơi Ñu pơhiăp anŭn. Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu dơ̆ng: “Ơ ƀing ană Kâo, tơnap biă mă yơh dưi mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai. 
It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. @ Amuñ hloh kơ sa drơi aseh samô mŭt ƀơi amăng jrum hăng sa čô mơnuih pơdrŏng mŭt amăng dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai.”
And they were exceedingly astonished, saying to one another, And who can be saved? @ Ƀing ding kơna Ñu kơtuă biă mă hăng laĭ tơdruă gơñu: “Tui anŭn hlơi dưi klaih lĕ?”
But Jesus looking on them says, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God. @ Yêsu lăng kơ ƀing gơñu hăng laĭ: “Tơlơi anŭn mơnuih ƀu dưi ngă ôh, samơ̆ Ơi Adai dưi ngă; yua kơ abih bang tơlơi Ơi Adai dưi ngă soh sel.”
Peter began to say to him, Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee. @ Pêtrôs čơdơ̆ng laĭ hăng Yêsu: “Lăng anai, gơmơi hmâo lui laih abih bang tơlơi kiăng đuaĭ tui Ih.”
Jesus answering said, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, [or wife], or children, or lands, for my sake and for the sake of the gospel, @ Yêsu laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, abih bang hlơi pô lui laih sang ñu ƀôdah ƀing adơi ayŏng, amai adơi, amĭ ama, ƀing ană bă, ƀôdah lŏn hmua ñu yua kơ Kâo hăng yua kơ Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam,

And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was going on before them; and they were amazed, and were afraid as they followed. And taking the twelve again to [him], he began to tell them what was going to happen to him: @ Khua Yang Yêsu hăng ƀing ding kơna hlăk rơbat ƀơi jơlan đĭ nao pơ Yêrusalem, Yêsu rơbat nao hlâo ƀơi anăp gơñu.

Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered up to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him up to the nations: @ Ñu laĭ: “Hmư̆ bĕ, ƀing ta nao pơ plei Yêrusalem, arăng či jao lui Ană Mơnuih kơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laih anŭn kơ ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt.

And there come to him James and John, the sons of Zebedee, saying [to him], Teacher, we would that whatsoever we may ask thee, thou wouldst do it for us. @ Yakơ hăng Yôhan, ƀing ană đah rơkơi Sêbêdê, nao pơ anăp Yêsu hăng tơña kơ Ñu: “Ơ Nai, gơmơi kiăng kơ Ih ngă brơi gơmơi hơgĕt tơlơi gơmơi rơkâo.”
And he said to them, What would ye that I should do for you? @ Yêsu tơña: “Hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih kiăng kơ Kâo ngă brơi?”
And they said to him, Give to us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and one on thy left hand, in thy glory. @ Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Amăng dêh čar pơtao ang yang Ih, rơkâo kơ Ih brơi gơmơi dŏ ber sa čô gah hơnuă laih anŭn sa čô gah iao Ih.”
And Jesus said to them, Ye do not know what ye ask. Are ye able to drink the cup which *I* drink, or be baptised with the baptism that *I* am baptised with? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih ƀu thâo ôh hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih rơkâo.

And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that *I* drink ye will drink and with the baptism that *I* am baptised with ye will be baptised, @ Gơñu laĭ: “Gơmơi dưi mơ̆n.”
Tui anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih či mơñum kơčok Kâo či mơñum, laih anŭn ƀing gih či tŭ tơlơi ƀatem Kâo tŭ.

And the ten having heard [of it], began to be indignant about James and John. @ Tơ ƀing pluh čô hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơñu čơdơ̆ng hil Yakơ hăng Yôhan. 
But Jesus having called them to [him], says to them, Ye know that those who are esteemed to rule over the nations exercise lordship over them; and their great men exercise authority over them; @ Yêsu iâu gơñu rai pơ Ñu hăng laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih thâo laih ƀing mơnuih arăng brơi wai lăng ƀing djuai tuai khăp yua tơlơi kơtư̆ juă wai lăng plei pla, laih anŭn ƀing khua prŏng gơñu khăp yua tơlơi dưi kơtang kiăng gĭt gai ană plei.

And they come to Jericho, and as he was going out from Jericho, and his disciples and a large crowd, the son of Timaeus, Bartimaeus, the blind [man], sat by the wayside begging. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu truh pơ plei Yêrikô.

And, throwing away his garment, he started up and came to Jesus. @ Gơ̆ toh glŏm lui hĭ ao phyung gơ̆, tơgŭ mơtam, hăng nao pơ Yêsu.

And they come to Jerusalem, and entering into the temple, he began to cast out those who sold and who bought in the temple, and he overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the dove-sellers, @ Gơñu truh pơ plei Yêrusalem, Yêsu mŭt amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ hăng čơdơ̆ng puh pơđuaĭ ƀing sĭ mơdrô mơ̆ng sang anŭn.

And he taught saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? but *ye* have made it a den of robbers. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu pơtô laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih: ‘Arăng či iâu sang Kâo jing sang iâu laĭ kơ abih bang djuai mơnuih’?

And the chief priests and the scribes heard [it], and they sought how they might destroy him; for they feared him, because all the crowd were astonished at his doctrine. @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn gơñu čơdơ̆ng hơduah jơlan pơdjai Yêsu.

And they come again to Jerusalem. And as he walked about in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders come to him, @ Ƀing gơñu nao pơ plei Yêrusalem dơ̆ng. Tơdang Yêsu rơbat amăng sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt, hăng ƀing kŏng tha nao pơ Ñu.

And Jesus answering said to them, *I* also will ask you one thing, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things: @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo či tơña kơ ƀing gih sa tơlơi; laĭ glaĭ bĕ kơ Kâo, laih anŭn Kâo či laĭ brơi kơ ƀing gih hăng tơlơi dưi hơgĕt Kâo ngă hơdôm tơlơi anai.

And they answering say to Jesus, We do not know.

And he began to say to them in parables, A man planted a vineyard, and made a fence round [it] and dug a wine-vat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and left the country. @  Yêsu čơdơ̆ng yua tơlơi bơhmutu kiăng pơtô ƀing gơñu. “Sa čô mơnuih pla sa boh đang boh kơƀâu.

And they sought to lay hold of him, and they feared the crowd; for they knew that he had spoken the parable of them.

And they come and say to him, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and carest not for any one; for thou regardest not men's person, but teachest the way of God with truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? @ Gơñu rai laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, gơmơi thâo Ih jing mơnuih sĭt klă, laih anŭn ƀu bơngơ̆t ôh hyư̆m tơlơi arăng pơmĭn, yua kơ ih ƀu lăng ôh kơ hơgĕt tơlơi arăng jing, samơ̆ pơtô jơlan Ơi Adai tui hăng tơlơi tơpă sĭt.

And Jesus answering said to them, Pay what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God. And they wondered at him. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ba glaĭ bĕ kơ Sêsar hơgĕt lơ̆m kơ Sêsar, laih anŭn ba glaĭ bĕ kơ Ơi Adai hơgĕt lơ̆m kơ Ơi Adai.” Gơñu dŏ kơtuă hling biă mă kơ tơlơi Yêsu pơhiăp anŭn.
And Sadducees come to him, that say there is no resurrection; and they demanded of him saying, @  Hmâo đơđa ƀing Sadusi rai pơ Yêsu, ƀing anŭn laĭ ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơdip glaĭ ôh. Gơñu tơña kơ Yêsu tui anai: 
Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if any one's brother die, and leave a wife behind, and leave no children, that his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother. @ “Ơ Nai, Môis hmâo čih brơi kơ gơmơi, tơdah sa čô mơnuih hmâo ayŏng dŏ bơnai, ñu djai hĭ pioh glaĭ bơnai ñu samơ̆ ƀu hmâo ană ôh, adơi ñu khŏm dŏ bơnai ñu kiăng hmâo ană djă pioh djuai kơ ayŏng ñu. 
There were seven brethren; and the first took a wife, and dying did not leave seed; @ Hmâo tơjuh čô adơi ayŏng. Ayŏng tha dŏ bơnai, samơ̆ ñu djai hĭ ƀu hmâo ană ôh. 
and the second took her and died, and neither did he leave seed; and the third likewise. @ Pô tal dua dŏ đah kơmơi anŭn, laih anŭn djai hĭ ƀu hmâo ană mơ̆n, wơ̆t adơi tal klâo ăt kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
And the seven [took her and] did not leave seed. Last of all the woman also died. @ Tui anŭn abih tơjuh čô adơi ayŏng anŭn ƀu hmâo ană ôh. Hnal tuč đah kơmơi anŭn ăt djai mơ̆n. 
In the resurrection, when they shall rise again, of which of them shall she be wife, for the seven had her as wife? @ Tơ gơñu hơdip amăng hrơi hơdip glaĭ, ñu či jing bơnai kơ pô hlơi, yua kơ abih tơjuh čô anŭn leng kơ hmâo dŏ gơ̆ soh sel?”
And Jesus answering said to them, Do not ye therefore err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă ƀing gih soh tơhwơl laih yua kơ ƀing gih ƀu thâo hluh ôh Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp, kŏn thâo hluh lơi tơlơi dưi mơyang Ơi Adai? 
For when they rise from among [the] dead they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels [who are] in the heavens. @ Yua kơ tơ arăng hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng ƀing djai, ƀing đah rơkơi ƀu či dŏ bơnai dơ̆ng ôh, ƀing đah kơmơi ăt ƀu či dŏ rơkơi dơ̆ng lơi; samơ̆ gơñu či jing kar hăng ƀing ling jang amăng adai. 
But concerning the dead that they rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses, in [the section of] the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, *I* [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? @ Bơ kơ tơlơi ƀing djai hơdip glaĭ, ƀing gih ƀu hmâo lăng ôh hă amăng hơdrôm hră Môis, anih pơhiăp djơ̆ kơ apui dŏ ƀơ̆ng pum drơi hyư̆m Tơlơi Ơi Adai laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Kâo jing Ơi Adai kơ Abraham, Ơi Adai kơ Isak laih anŭn Ơi Adai kơ Yakôp?’ 
He is not the God of [the] dead, but of [the] living. *Ye* therefore greatly err. @ Ñu ƀu djơ̆ jing Ơi Adai kơ ƀing djai ôh, samơ̆ Ơi Adai kơ ƀing hơdip. Ƀing gih soh tơhwơl biă mă.”
And one of the scribes who had come up, and had heard them reasoning together, perceiving that he had answered them well, demanded of him, Which is [the] first commandment of all? @  Hmâo sa čô amăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt rai hăng hmư̆ tơlơi gơñu pơrơjah hăng Yêsu, hăng hmư̆ tơlơi Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ ƀing Sadusi thâo djơ̆ biă mă, ñu tơña kơ Yêsu: “Tơlơi pơtă pă yom hloh kơ abih bang?”
And Jesus answered him, [The] first commandment of all [is], Hear, Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord; @  Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơlơi pơtă yom hloh kơ abih bang anŭn jing: ‘Hmư̆ bĕ, Ơ ƀing Israel! Khua Yang Ơi Adai ƀing ta jing Khua Yang hmâo kơnơ̆ng hasa đôč. 
and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding, and with all thy strength. This is [the] first commandment. @ Ih khŏm khăp kơ Khua yang Ơi Adai ih hăng abih pran jua, hăng abih bơngăt, hăng abih tơlơi pơmĭn, laih anŭn hăng abih tơlơi kơtang ih.’ 
And a second like it [is] this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is not another commandment greater than these. @ Anai jing Tơlơi Pơtă tal dua: ‘Ih khŏm khăp kơ mơnuih jum dar ih kar hăng ih khăp kơ ih pô.’ Ƀu hmâo dơ̆ng tah tơlơi pơtă pơkŏn prŏng hloh kơ dua mơta tơlơi anai.”
And the scribe said to him, Right, teacher; thou hast spoken according to [the] truth. For he is one, and there is none other besides him; @  Nai pơtô tơlơi juăt anŭn laĭ hăng Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, djơ̆ yơh, ih laĭ djơ̆ biă mă Ơi Adai kơnơ̆ng jing hasa đôč, laih anŭn ƀu hmâo Pô pơkŏn dơ̆ng ôh. 
and to love him with all the heart, and with all the intelligence, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbour as one's self, is more than all the burnt-offerings and sacrifices. @ Sĭt yơh, tơlơi khăp kơ Ñu hăng abih pran jua, hăng abih tơlơi thâo hluh, hăng abih tơlơi kơtang, laih anŭn khăp kơ mơnuih jum dar kar hăng ih khăp kơ ih pô, jing yom hloh kơ abih bang mơnơ̆ng ngă yang čuh hăng mơnơ̆ng ngă yang pơkŏn.”
And Jesus, seeing that he had answered intelligently, said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no one dared question him any more. @ Tơ Yêsu ƀuh mơnuih anŭn laĭ glaĭ hăng tơlơi kơhnâo, Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ih ƀu ataih ôh hăng dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai.” Giơ̆ng tơlơi anŭn ƀu hmâo dơ̆ng tah sa čô khĭn tơña kơ Ñu sa tơlơi.
And Jesus answering said [as he was] teaching in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is son of David? @ Tơdang Yêsu dŏ pơtô amăng sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ, Ñu laĭ: “Hyư̆m ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt dưi laĭ Krist jing ană pơtao Đawit lĕ? 
[for] David himself said [speaking] in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet. @ Đawit pô hmâo tơlơi pơtrŭt mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam laĭ tui anai:

David himself [therefore] calls him Lord, and whence is he his son? And the mass of the people heard him gladly. @ Đawit pô iâu Ñu Khua Yang. Tui anŭn hyư̆m Ñu dưi jing ană đah rơkơi Đawit lĕ?” Ƀing mơnuih lu dŏ hmư̆ Yêsu hăng tơlơi hơ̆k mơak.
And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and salutations in the marketplaces, @ Tơdang Yêsu dŏ pơtô, Ñu laĭ tui anai: “Răng bĕ kơ ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt, jing ƀing khăp buh ao phyung rơbat hyu, hăng kiăng kơ arăng kơkuh kơ gơñu amăng sang sĭ mơdrô.

And Jesus, having sat down opposite the treasury, saw how the crowd was casting money into the treasury; and many rich cast in much. @ Yêsu dŏ ber pơklă anăp hăng hip pơyơr prăk amăng sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ, lăng ƀing mơnuih lu pơyơr prăk amăng hip anŭn. Ƀing pơdrŏng pơyơr lu prăk. 
And a poor widow came and cast in two mites, which is a farthing. @ Hlăk anŭn hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi blao rai pơyơr dua su prăk anĕt, jing sa kak. 
And having called his disciples to [him] he said to them, Verily I say unto you, This poor widow has cast in more than all who have cast into the treasury: @ Yêsu iâu ƀing ding kơna Ñu hăng laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, đah kơmơi blao ƀun rin anai hmâo pơyơr laih amăng hip pơyơr prăk lu hloh kơ ƀing pơkŏn.

And as he was going out of the temple, one of his disciples says to him, Teacher, see what stones and what buildings! @ Tơ Yêsu tơbiă mơ̆ng Sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ, sa čô amăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu laĭ: “Ơ Nai, lăng bĕ, khul boh pơtâo prŏng hăng abih bang sang prŏng anai hiam kloh noh biă mă.”
And Jesus answering said to him, Seest thou these great buildings? not a stone shall be left upon a stone, which shall not be thrown down. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ih ƀuh mơ̆ abih bang sang prŏng anai? Ƀu hmâo ôh sa klŏ boh pơtâo či dŏ ƀơi hăng ngŏ boh pơtâo pơkŏn, samơ̆ abih bang či tơglưh hĭ abih.”
And as he sat on the mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, @ Tơdang Yêsu dŏ ber ƀơi čư̆ Ôliwơ pơklă anăp hăng Sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ, Pêtrôs, Yakơ, Yôhan, hăng Andrê nao tơña hơjăn hăng Yêsu,

And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any one mislead you. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Răng bĕ, anăm brơi arăng plư ƀing gih ôh.

But *ye*, take heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you up to sanhedrims and to synagogues: ye shall be beaten and brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them; @  “Răng bĕ kơ ƀing gih pô, yua kơ arăng či jao hĭ ƀing gih kơ ƀing khua phat kơđi, arăng či taih čŏm ƀing gih amăng sang jơnum.

Now the passover and the [feast of] unleavened bread was after two days. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might seize him by subtlety and kill him. @  Dŏ dua hrơi hlâo kơ phĕt Tơlơi Găn hăng phĕt Ƀañ Tơpŭng Ƀu Hmâo Tơpơi, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hơduah jơlan kiăng mă Yêsu hăng tơlơi hơgơ̆m laih anŭn pơdjai hĭ Gơ̆. 
For they said, Not in the feast, lest perhaps there be a tumult of the people. @ Yua kơ gơñu laĭ: “Ta ƀu dưi ngă ôh hlăk hrơi phĕt, hwĭ kơ ƀing ană plei pla rŭng răng.”
And when he was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, as he lay at table, there came a woman having an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly; and having broken the alabaster flask, she poured it out upon his head. @  Hlăk Yêsu dŏ pơ Plei Bêthani amăng sang Simôn pô djơ̆ phŭng.

And there were some indignant in themselves, and saying, Why has this waste been made of the ointment? @ Samơ̆ hmâo đơđa hil laĭ tơdruă gơñu: “Yua hơgĕt plai hĭ đôč đač ia ƀâu mơngưi kar hăng anŭn?

But Jesus said, Let her alone; why do ye trouble her? she has wrought a good work as to me; @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ: “Lui măk ai ñu. Yua hơgĕt ƀing gih pơrŭng gơ̆? Ñu ngă tơlơi hiam kơ Kâo.

And Judas Iscariote, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests that he might deliver him up to them; @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yudas Iskariôt, sa čô amăng pluh dua čô ƀing khua ding kơna nao pơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng kiăng pơblư̆ hăng jao hĭ Yêsu kơ gơñu. 
and they, when they heard it, rejoiced, and promised him to give money. And he sought how he could opportunely deliver him up. @ Tơ hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn gơñu hơ̆k mơak biă mă, laih anŭn ƀuăn či brơi prăk kơ Yudas. Tui anŭn Yudas hơduah mông gal kiăng kơ pơblư̆ hĭ Yêsu.
And the first day of unleavened bread, when they slew the passover, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou mayest eat the passover? @ Hrơi tal sa amăng phĕt Ƀañ Tơpŭng Ƀu Hmâo Tơpơi, hrơi arăng pơdjai ană triu phĕt Tơlơi Găn, ƀing ding kơna tơña kơ Yêsu: “Pơpă anih Ih kiăng gơmơi nao pơkra brơi kơ Ih ƀơ̆ng phĕt Tơlơi Găn?”
And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Go into the city, and a man shall meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him. @ Ñu pơkiaŏ nao dua čô ƀing ding kơna Ñu hăng laĭ kơ gơñu: “Nao bĕ mŭt amăng plei, či hmâo sa čô đah rơkơi đua sa boh čeh ia či bưp ƀing gih. Đuaĭ tui ñu bĕ. 
And wheresoever he enters, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is my guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples? @ Sang pă ñu mŭt, brơi ƀing gih laĭ kơ pô sang anŭn: ‘Nai laĭ, pơpă anih kâo či ƀơ̆ng phĕt Tơlơi Găn hrŏm hăng ƀing ding kơna Kâo?’

And his disciples went away and came into the city, and found as he had said to them; and they made ready the passover. @ Ƀing ding kơna anŭn nao mŭt amăng plei hăng ƀuh abih bang tơlơi tui hăng Yêsu hmâo laĭ laih kơ gơñu. Laih anŭn gơñu pơkra phĕt Tơlơi Găn.
And when evening was come, he comes with the twelve. @ Tơ adai mơmŏt laih, Yêsu nao hrŏm hăng pluh dua čô khua ding kơna. 
And as they lay at table and were eating, Jesus said, Verily I say to you, One of you shall deliver me up; he who is eating with me. @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă ƀơi kơƀang, Yêsu laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, sa čô amăng ƀing gih dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Kâo, či pơblư̆ lui Kâo.”
And they began to be grieved, and to say to him, one by one, Is it *I*? [and another, Is it *I*?] @ Ƀing gơñu rơngot biă mă, rĭm čô gơñu čơdơ̆ng tơña kơ Yêsu: “Ƀu djơ̆ kâo ôh, djơ̆ mơ̆?”
But he answered and said to them, One of the twelve, he who dips with me in the dish. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Pô anŭn jing sa čô amăng pluh dua čô, jing pô hlăk añrŭ ƀañ tơpŭng ñu amăng jam hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Kâo. 
The Son of man goes indeed as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; [it were] good for that man if he had not been born. @ Ană Mơnuih či djai tui hăng Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih djơ̆ kơ Ñu, samơ̆ răm ƀăm yơh kơ pô pơblư̆ lui Ană Mơnuih!

And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken bread, when he had blessed, broke [it], and gave [it] to them, and said, Take [this]: this is my body. @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă, Yêsu mă ƀañ tơpŭng, iâu laĭ bơni hơơč, Ñu wơ̆k ƀañ tơpŭng brơi kơ ƀing gơñu hăng laĭ: “Mă bĕ; anai jing drơi jan Kâo.”
And having taken [the] cup, when he had given thanks, he gave [it] to them, and they all drank out of it. @ Ñu mă kơčok, iâu laĭ bơni hơơč, giơ̆ng anŭn Ñu brơi kơ ƀing gơñu, laih anŭn abih bang gơñu mơñum. 
And he said to them, This is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Anai jing drah Kâo, drah kơ tơlơi kơnol pơgop hmâo tuh brơi kơ lu mơnuih. 
Verily I say to you, I will no more drink at all of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. @ Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, Kâo ƀu či mơñum tơpai boh kơƀâu anai dơ̆ng ôh tơl hrơi Kâo či mơñum tơpai boh kơƀâu phrâo amăng Dêh Čar Pơtao Ơi Adai.”
And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives. @ Giơ̆ng gơñu adoh sa tơlơi adoh bơni hơơč, gơñu tơbiă nao pơ čư̆ Ôliwơ.
And Jesus says to them, All ye shall be offended, for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad. @ Yêsu laĭ hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Abih bang ƀing gih či đuaĭ lui Kâo; yua kơ Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih:

But after I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee. @  Samơ̆ giơ̆ng Kâo hơdip glaĭ, Kâo či nao hlâo kơ ƀing gih pơ kwar Galilê”.
But Peter said to him, Even if all should be offended, yet not *I*. @ Pêtrôs laĭ hăng Ñu: “Wơ̆t dah abih bang či lui hĭ Ih, kâo ƀu či lui Ih ôh.”
And Jesus says to him, Verily I say to thee, that thou to-day, in this night, before [the] cock shall crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ih, mlam anai yơh, hlâo kơ mơnŭ tơdjô̆ dua wơ̆t, ih či hơngah Kâo klâo wơ̆t.”
But he said [so much] exceedingly the more, If I should have to die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. And likewise said they all too. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs laĭ hăng tơlơi khŭt khăt hloh dơ̆ng: “Wơ̆t dah kâo djai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ih tŭ mơ̆n, kâo ƀu či hơngah Ih ôh.” Laih anŭn abih bang gơñu ăt laĭ hrup hăng anŭn.
And they come to a place of which the name [is] Gethsemane, and he says to his disciples, Sit here while I shall pray. @ Gơñu nao pơ anih arăng pia Gêtsêmanê, laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Dŏ ber bĕ ƀơi anai tơdang Kâo nao iâu laĭ.” 
And he takes with him Peter and James and John, and he began to be amazed and oppressed in spirit. @ Yêsu jak ba Pêtrôs, Yakơ hăng Yôhan nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu, Ñu čơdơ̆ng hmâo tơlơi rơngot hăng rŭng răng kơtang biă mă. 
And he says to them, My soul is full of grief even unto death; abide here and watch. @ Ñu laĭ hăng gơñu: “Pran jua Kâo rơngot biă mă tơl či djai, dŏ pơ anai laih anŭn dŏ krŏng bĕ.” 
And, going forward a little, he fell upon the earth; and he prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him. @ Ñu nao ataih ƀiă, Ñu bon ƀơi lŏn laih anŭn iâu laĭ, kiăng kơ tơdah dưi rơkâo mông anŭn anăm truh kơ Ñu ôh. 
And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: take away this cup from me; but not what *I* will, but what *thou* [wilt]. @ Ñu laĭ: “Aba, Ơ Ama, abih bang tơlơi Ih dưi ngă soh sel.

And he comes and finds them sleeping. And he says to Peter, Simon, dost thou sleep? Hast thou not been able to watch one hour? @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Ñu wơ̆t glaĭ hăng ƀuh gơñu dŏ pĭt; Ñu laĭ kơ Pêtrôs: “Ơ Simôn, ih dŏ pĭt hă? Ih ƀu dưi dŏ krŏng amăng sa mông ôh hă? 
Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh weak. @ Dŏ krŏng hăng iâu laĭ bĕ, kiăng kơ ƀing gih ƀu lĕ amăng tơlơi plư ôh. Bơngăt jua kiăng biă mă, samơ̆ asar đeh tơdu.” 
And going away, he prayed again, saying the same thing. @ Yêsu nao sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng hăng iâu laĭ kar hăng hlâo mơ̆n. 
And returning, he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy; and they knew not what they should answer him. @ Yêsu wơ̆t glaĭ dơ̆ng hăng ƀuh ƀing ding kơna Ñu ăt dŏ pĭt, yua kơ mơta gơñu ƀu dưi blang ôh. Gơñu ƀu thâo hyư̆m či laĭ glaĭ kơ Yêsu ôh. 
And he comes the third time and says to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest. It is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners. @ Tơ Yêsu wơ̆t glaĭ tal klâo hăng laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih ăt dŏ pĭt hăng dŏ pơdơi hă?

Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh. @ Ƀing ta tơgŭ nao bĕ. Lăng adih, pô pơblư̆ lui Kâo truh yơh.”
And immediately, while he was yet speaking, Judas comes up, [being] one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. @ Ƀơi mông Yêsu hlăk dŏ pơhiăp, Yudas, sa čô amăng ƀing pluh dua čô khua ding kơna, truh mơtam hrŏm hơbĭt hăng sa phung lu djă đao gưm, djă gai, mơ̆ng ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hăng ƀing kŏng tha pơkiaŏ rai.

And being come, straightway coming up to him, he says, Rabbi, Rabbi; and he covered him with kisses. @ Tơ Yudas truh, ñu nao pơ Yêsu mơtam hăng laĭ: “Ơ Nai” Ñu čŭm Yêsu. 
And they laid their hands upon him and seized him. @ Ƀing anŭn mă čaŏ Yêsu.

And a certain young man followed him with a linen cloth cast about his naked [body]; and [the young men] seize him; @ Hmâo sa čô tơdăm kơnơ̆ng sŏm sa blah khăn kơbuă đuaĭ tui Yêsu. 
but he, leaving the linen cloth behind [him], fled from them naked. @ Gơñu mă tơdăm anŭn, samơ̆ ñu blač hĭ mơ̆ng khăn kơbuă anŭn hăng đuaĭ drơi mơhlŭn.
And they led away Jesus to the high priest. And there come together to him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. @ Gơñu ba Yêsu pơ sang khua ngă yang prŏng hloh. Abih bang ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, ƀing kŏng tha, laih anŭn ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hmâo pơƀŭt glaĭ laih pơ anŭn. 
And Peter followed him at a distance, till [he was] within the court of the high priest's palace; and he was sitting with the officers and warming himself in the light [of the fire]. @ Pêtrôs đuaĭ tui Yêsu mơ̆ng ataih ataih, mŭt amăng wăl sang khua ngă yang prŏng hloh. Ñu dŏ ber hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing tơhan gak dŏ mơdang apui pơ anŭn. 
And the chief priests and the whole sanhedrim sought testimony against Jesus to cause him to be put to death, and did not find [any]. @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng abih bang tơpul khua gĭt gai ană plei pla hơduah tơhnal tơlơi pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ hăng Yêsu kiăng pơdjai hĭ Ñu, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu dưi sem ƀuh tơlơi hơgĕt ôh. 
For many bore false witness against him, and their testimony did not agree. @ Yua kơ hmâo lu mơnuih ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơkơdơ̆ng hăng Yêsu, samơ̆ abih tơlơi gơñu pơčŭt ƀu hmâo sa hơnơ̆ng ôh. 
And certain persons rose up and bore false witness against him, saying, @ Hmâo đơđa mơnuih tơgŭ dơ̆ng pơčeh pơkơdơ̆ng hăng Yêsu, laĭ, 
*We* heard him saying, *I* will destroy this temple which is made with hands, and in the course of three days I will build another not made with hands. @ “Gơmơi hmâo hmư̆ Ñu laĭ: ‘Kâo či pơrai hĭ Sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ tơngan ană mơnuih ngă anai, laih anŭn amăng klâo hrơi Kâo či pơdơ̆ng glaĭ sa boh sang kơkuh pơpŭ pơkŏn dơ̆ng, ƀu djơ̆ hăng tơngan ană mơnuih ôh.’” 
And neither thus did their testimony agree. @ Samơ̆ wơ̆t amăng tơlơi anai, tơlơi gơñu ngă gơ̆ng jơlan anŭn ăt ƀu hơnơ̆ng ôh.
And the high priest, rising up before them all, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? What do these testify against thee? @ Khua ngă yang prŏng hloh tơgŭ dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp gơñu hăng tơña kơ Yêsu: “Ih ƀu hmâo tơlơi laĭ glaĭ ôh hă kơ abih tơlơi ƀing anai pơčŭt kơ Ih?” 
But he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and says to him, *Thou* art the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu ăt dŏ rơiăt, ƀu pơhiăp sa boh ôh. Sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng khua ngă yang prŏng hloh tơña Yêsu: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ Ih jing Yang Krist Ană Ơi Adai Pô arăng hơơč bơni?” 
And Jesus said, *I* am, and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Sĭt Kâo gơ̆ yơh,

And the high priest, having rent his clothes, says, What need have we any more of witnesses? @ Khua ngă yang prŏng hloh hek hĭ ao ñu pô hăng laĭ: “Hơgĕt ƀing ta dŏ kiăng kơ tơlơi ƀing arăng ngă gơ̆ng jơlan dơ̆ng?

And some began to spit upon him, and cover up his face, and buffet him, and say to him, Prophesy; and the officers struck him with the palms of their hands. @ Hmâo đơđa amăng gơñu čơdơ̆ng kơčuh ia bah kơ Yêsu, gom ƀô̆ mơta Ñu, čok Ñu hăng laĭ: “Ih đaŏ lăng hlơi pô taih Ih!” Ƀing tơhan gak mă hăng pah meng Gơ̆.
And Peter being below in the palace-court, there comes one of the maids of the high priest, @ Hlăk Pêtrôs dŏ ƀơi gah yŭ amăng wăl sang, sa čô ding kơna đah kơmơi khua ngă yang prŏng hloh rai giăm. 
and seeing Peter warming himself, having looked at him, says, And *thou* wast with the Nazarene, Jesus. @ Ñu ƀuh Pêtrôs dŏ mơdang apui, ñu lăng kơ Pêtrôs hăng laĭ: “Ih ăt jing pô dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu plei Nasaret.” 
But he denied, saying, I know not nor understand what thou sayest. And he went out into the vestibule; and a cock crew. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs hơngah hăng laĭ: “Kâo ƀu thâo ôh kŏn thâo hluh lơi hơgĕt ih laĭ anŭn.” Pêtrôs tơbiă nao pơ bah amăng wăl sang. Hlăk anŭn mơnŭ tơdjô̆. 
And the maid, seeing him, again began to say to those that stood by, This is [one] of them. @ Ding kơna đah kơmơi anŭn ƀuh ñu dơ̆ng, hăng laĭ kơ ƀing dŏ giăm anŭn: “Pô anai jing sa čô amăng ƀing anŭn mơ̆n.” 
And he again denied. And again, after a little, those that stood by said to Peter, Truly thou art [one] of them, for also thou art a Galilean. @ Samơ̆ sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng Pêtrôs hơngah. Tơdơi ƀiă kơ anŭn ƀing dŏ giăm laĭ kơ Pêtrôs: “Sĭt biă mă ih jing sa čô amăng ƀing anŭn, yua kơ ih jing mơnuih Galilê.” 
But he began to curse and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs čơdơ̆ng hơtơ̆m tơĭ hăng ƀuăn rơ̆ng ñu pô: “Kâo ƀu thâo krăn ôh mơnuih ƀing gih laĭ anŭn!”
And the second time a cock crew. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus said to him, Before [the] cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice; and when he thought thereon he wept. @ Hlăk anŭn mơtam, mơnŭ tơdjô̆ tal dua.

And immediately in the morning the chief priests, having taken counsel with the elders and scribes and the whole sanhedrim, bound Jesus and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] up to Pilate. @ Man ưm mơguah, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, ƀing kŏng tha, ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt, abih bang ƀing khua phat kơđi črŏng sai; gơñu čaŏ Yêsu laih anŭn ba jao kơ Pilat. 
And Pilate asked him, Art *thou* the King of the Jews? And he answered and said to him, *Thou* sayest. @ Pilat tơña kơ Yêsu: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ Ih jing pơtao ană Yuđa?” Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Sĭt, djơ̆ tui hăng ih laĭ yơh.” 
And the chief priests accused him urgently. @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng pơčŭt kơ Yêsu lu tơlơi. 
And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? See of how many things they bear witness against thee. @ Pilat tơña kơ Yêsu: “Ih ƀu laĭ glaĭ ôh hă? Hmư̆ bĕ tơlơi gơñu pơčŭt kơ Ih lu biă mă.” 
But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu ƀu laĭ glaĭ ôh, tui anŭn Pilat kơtuă hling biă mă.
But at [the] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they begged [of him]. @ Rĭm wơ̆t phĕt Tơlơi Găn Pilat juăt phư brơi sa čô mơnă, tui hăng hlơi ană plei pla rơkâo. 
Now there was the [person] named Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection with [him], [and] that had committed murder in the insurrection. @ Hlăk anŭn hmâo sa čô mơnuih anăn ñu Barabas arăng krư̆ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ngă pơrŭng, jing ƀing mơnuih soh yua kơ tơlơi pơdjai mơnuih amăng tơlơi ngă pơrŭng pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ. 
And the crowd crying out began to beg [that he would do] to them as he had always done. @ Ƀing mơnuih lu rai rơkâo kơ Pilat ngă tui hăng tơlơi juăt ñu hmâo ngă laih kơ ană plei pla. 
But Pilate answered them saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews? @ Pilat tơña kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih kiăng mơ̆ kâo phư brơi kơ ƀing gih pơtao ană Yuđa?” 
for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up through envy. @ Yua kơ ñu thâo rơđah ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hmâo jao Yêsu kơ ñu yua kơ gơñu rơañ. 
But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that he might rather release Barabbas to them. @ Samơ̆ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng pơsur ană plei pla rơkâo kơ Pilat phư brơi Barabas. 
And Pilate answering said to them again, What will ye then that I do [to him] whom ye call King of the Jews? @ Pilat tơña dơ̆ng kơ ƀing ană plei pla: “Tui anŭn hơgĕt kâo či ngă hăng mơnuih pô ƀing gih iâu Pơtao ană Yuđa?” 
And they cried out again, Crucify him. @ Gơñu ur dơ̆ng: “Pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal!” 
And Pilate said to them, What evil then has he done? But they cried out the more urgently, Crucify him. @ Pilat tơña: “Hyư̆m, hơgĕt tơlơi soh Ñu hmâo ngă?” Ƀing gơñu ur jai kơtang hloh dơ̆ng: “Pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal!” 
And Pilate, desirous of contenting the crowd, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, that he might be crucified. @ Yua kơ Pilat kiăng ngă bơmơak kơ ană plei pla, tui anŭn ñu phư Barabas brơi kơ gơñu. Giơ̆ng ñu brơi arăng taih Yêsu hăng gai, ñu jao Yêsu brơi kơ ƀing tơhan ba nao pơ̆ng ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal.
And the soldiers led him away into the court which is [called the] praetorium, and they call together the whole band. @ Ƀing tơhan ba Yêsu mŭt amăng wăl sang khua čar (kiăng laĭ sang phat kơđi), gơñu iâu pơƀŭt abih bang tơpul tơhan hrŏm hơbĭt. 
And they clothe him with purple, and bind round on him a crown of thorns which they had plaited. @ Gơñu buh brơi Yêsu sa blah ao phyung mriah, laih anŭn gơñu mơñam sa boh mŭk pơtao hăng drơi laih anŭn đua brơi ƀơi akŏ Yêsu. 
And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! @ Gơñu čơdơ̆ng kơkuh kơ Yêsu: “Kơkuh kơ Ih, Ơ pơtao ƀing ană Yuđa ah!” 
And they struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and, bending the knee, did him homage. @ Gơñu taih akŏ Yêsu hăng gai trang bô, kơčuh ia bah ƀơi Yêsu, hăng čon tơŭt kơkuh kơ Yêsu. 
And when they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own clothes on him; and they lead him out that they may crucify him. @ Giơ̆ng gơñu mưč kơ Yêsu, gơñu toh hĭ ao phyung mriah, gơñu buh brơi ao Yêsu Pô dơ̆ng. Laih anŭn gơñu ba nao pơ̆ng Yêsu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal.
And they compel to go [with them] a certain passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might carry his cross. @  Ƀơi jơlan, gơñu bưp sa čô mơnuih anăn Simôn mơ̆ng čar Siren, ama Aleksandơ hăng Ruphus, rai mơ̆ng gah rơngiao plei găn nao ƀơi anŭn.

And they bring him to the place [called] Golgotha, which, being interpreted, is Place of a skull. @ Gơñu ba Yêsu pơ anih arăng pơanăn Gôlgôtha, (kiăng laĭ anih klang akŏ). 
And they offered him wine [to drink] medicated with myrrh; but he did not take [it]. @ Gơñu pơgŏ Yêsu mơñum tơpai klai hăng ia jrao krŏn phĭ ƀâu mơngưi, samơ̆ Yêsu ƀu mơñum ôh. 
And having crucified him, they part his clothes amongst [themselves], casting lots on them, what each one should take. @ Giơ̆ng kơ gơñu pơ̆ng Yêsu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal laih, gơñu pơpha tơdruă gơñu bơnal ao Yêsu hăng tơlơi mă črăm, kiăng kơ thâo hơgĕt rĭm čô gơñu či mă tŭ. 
And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. @ Ƀơi dua rơpăn mông mơguah gơñu pơ̆ng Yêsu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal. 
And the superscription of what he was accused of was written up: The King of the Jews. @ Arăng čih tơlơi klă kơđi kơ Yêsu tui anai: “PƠTAO KƠ ɃING YUĐA” 
And with him they crucify two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left. @ Gơñu ăt pơ̆ng mơ̆n dua čô mơnuih klĕ dŏp hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu, sa čô gah hơnuă, sa čô gah iao.
And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying, Aha, thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days, @  Ƀing găn ƀơi anŭn mưč mač kơ Yêsu, tơtah akŏ hăng laĭ: “Ah hah! Ơ pô kiăng pơrai hĭ Sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ hăng pơdơ̆ng glaĭ dơ̆ng amăng klâo hrơi, 
save thyself, and descend from the cross. @ pơklaih bĕ pô ih, hăng trŭn mơ̆ng kơyâo bơrơkal.” 
In like manner the chief priests also, with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt mưč kơ Yêsu kar kaĭ mơ̆n, tơdang bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu tui anai: “Ñu hmâo pơklaih ƀing pơkŏn, samơ̆ Ñu ƀu dưi pơklaih pô Ñu ôh. 
Let the Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and may believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him. @ Ơ Yang Krist, Pơtao ƀing Israel, trŭn bĕ mơ̆ng kơyâo bơrơkal ră anai, kiăng kơ ƀing gơmơi ƀuh hăng đaŏ!”

And when [the] sixth hour was come, there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour; @ Ƀơi yang hrơi dơ̆ng hmâo tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt djŏp djang čar tơl truh klâo mông klam. 
and at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, [saying], Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? @ Ƀơi klâo mông klam Yêsu ur kraih kơtang, “Êloi, Êloi, Lama sabaktani?” kiăng laĭ: “Ơ Ơi Adai kâo, Ơ Ơi Adai Kâo, yua hơgĕt Ih lui hĭ kâo?” 
And some of those who stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calls for Elias. @ Hmâo đơđa amăng ƀing dŏ giăm ƀơi anŭn hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn hăng laĭ: “Hmư̆ bĕ, Ñu iâu Êli.” 
And one, running and filling a sponge with vinegar, fixed it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down. @ Hmâo sa čô mơnuih nao mă pông diăn, añrŭ amăng ia tơpai mơsăm, kă ƀơi jŭng sa ƀĕ gai trang bô, yơr đĭ ƀơi amăng bah Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Tơguan bĕ, brơi ƀing ta krăp lăng thâo dah Êli či rai ba trŭn Ñu.” 
And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired. @ Yêsu ur kraih kơtang, giơ̆ng anŭn Ñu tơĭ pran.
And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom. @  Hlăk anŭn khăn păng amăng Sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ tơhek hĭ dua mơ̆ng ngŏ truh pơ yŭ. 
And the centurion who stood by over against him, when he saw that he had expired having thus cried out, said, Truly this man was Son of God. @ Pô khua tơhan dŏ klă anăp Yêsu ƀuh hyư̆m Ñu tơĭ pran, ñu laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă pô anai jing Ană Ơi Adai!” 
And there were women also looking on from afar off, among whom were both Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; @ Hmâo mơ̆n đơđa ƀing đah kơmơi dŏ lăng mơ̆ng ataih.

And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and having called to [him] the centurion, he inquired of him if he had long died. @ Pilat kơtuă biă mă yua kơ Yêsu djai laih. Ñu iâu khua tơhan hăng tơña kơ gơ̆ kiăng thâo klă Yêsu djai sui laih ƀôdah phrâo.

And having bought fine linen, [and] having taken him down, he swathed him in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre. @ Yôsep blơi sa blah khăn kơbuă, mă pơtrŭn drơi jan Yêsu, ñu pŏn hrôm Ñu hăng khăn kơbuă anŭn hăng pơđih Ñu amăng pơsat arăng hmâo ƀoh amăng boh pơtâo.

And Mary of Magdala and Mary the [mother] of Joses saw where he was put. @ HʼMari Madala hăng HʼMari amĭ Yôse leng kơ ƀuh anih arăng dơr drơi jan Yêsu.
And the sabbath being [now] past, Mary of Magdala, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, bought aromatic spices that they might come and embalm him. @ Tơdơi kơ hrơi Saƀat, HʼMari Madala, HʼMari amĭ Yakơ, hăng HʼSalômê blơi ia ƀâu mơngưi kiăng nao pik drơi jan Yêsu.

And they went out, and fled from the sepulchre.

Now when he had risen very early, the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons. @ Giơ̆ng Yêsu hơdip glaĭ laih, hlăk ưm mơguah hrơi tal sa amăng hrơi kơ̆m anŭn, Ñu pơƀuh Ñu pô blŭng hlâo kơ HʼMari Madala, jing pô Yêsu hmâo puh pơđuaĭ tơjuh čô yang sat mơ̆ng gơ̆.

There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth. @  Rơnŭk Hêrôt ngă pơtao čar Yuđa, hmâo sa čô khua ngă yang anăn ñu Sakari mơ̆ng tơpul Abija.

And it came to pass, as he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course, @ Djơ̆ tal tơpul ñu, Sakari ngă bruă khua ngă yang ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai. 
it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense. @ Tơ mă črăm tui hăng tơlơi juăt kơ ƀing khua ngă yang, ñu mă djơ̆ črăm dưi mŭt čuh mơnơ̆ng ƀâu mơngưi amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ Khua Yang.

And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this, for *I* am an old man, and my wife advanced in years? @ Sakari laĭ kơ ling jang: “Hyư̆m kâo dưi thâo tơlơi anŭn či truh sĭt lĕ? Yua kơ kâo tha laih, laih anŭn bơnai kâo ăt tha laih mơ̆n.”
And the angel answering, said to him, *I* am Gabriel, who stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to bring these glad tidings to thee; @  Ling jang laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo Gabriel, pô dŏ ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai.

But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they recognised that he had seen a vision in the temple.

And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, he departed to his house. @ Tơ khul hrơi ñu mă bruă abih laih, ñu glaĭ pơ sang.

And behold, Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her that was called barren: @ Anai nê, sa čô đah kơmơi kơnŭng djuai ih, HʼÊlisabet, hmâo pi kian laih sa čô ană đah rơkơi tơdang gơ̆ tha laih.

And it came to pass, as the angels departed from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, Let us make our way then now as far as Bethlehem, and let us see this thing that is come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us. @ Giơ̆ng kơ phung ling jang đuaĭ mơ̆ng gơñu wơ̆t glaĭ pơ adai, ƀing wai triu bơlaĭ hăng tơdruă gơñu: “Nao bĕ ƀing ta pơ Plei Betlêhem kiăng lăng tơlơi hmâo truh laih jing tơlơi Khua Yang hmâo laĭ pơthâo laih kơ ƀing ta.”

and rising up they cast him forth out of the city, and led him up to the brow of the mountain upon which their city was built, so that they might throw him down the precipice; @ Gơñu tơgŭ, dui tơbiă Yêsu pơ gah rơngiao plei, ba Ñu pơ akŏ čư̆ ƀơi anih arăng pơdơ̆ng plei, kiăng glŏm trŭn Ñu.

And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out from him.

And a rumour went out into every place of the country round concerning him. @ Arăng hmư̆ hing kơ Ñu tar ƀar anih jum dar.
And rising up out of the synagogue, he entered into the house of Simon.

And he was preaching in the synagogues of Galilee. @ Tui anŭn Ñu dŏ pơtô amăng sang bơjơnum amăng tring Yuđa.

And after these things he went forth and saw a tax-gatherer, Levi by name, sitting at the receipt of taxes, and said to him, Follow me. @ Giơ̆ng tơlơi anŭn Yêsu tơbiă laih anŭn ƀuh sa čô mơnuih ring jia, anăn gơ̆ Lêwi, dŏ ber ƀơi anih ring jia. Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Đuaĭ tui Kâo bĕ!” 
And having left all, rising up, he followed him. @ Gơ̆ lui hĭ abih bang, tơgŭ laih anŭn đuaĭ tui Yêsu.
And Levi made a great entertainment for him in his house, and there was a great crowd of tax-gatherers and others who were at table with them. @ Lêwi pơkra tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă prŏng jum Yêsu amăng sang ñu, laih anŭn hmâo lu ƀing ring jia laih anŭn ƀing mơnuih pơkŏn ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu.

And Jesus answering said to them, They that are in sound health have not need of a physician, but those that are ill. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ gơñu: “Ƀu djơ̆ ƀing mơnuih suaih prăl ôh kiăng kơ ơi ia jrao, samơ̆ ƀing mơnuih duăm ruă yơh.

And they said to him, Why do the disciples of John fast often and make supplications, in like manner those also of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink? @ Ƀing anŭn laĭ kơ Ñu: “Ƀing ding kơna Yôhan nanao ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă laih anŭn iâu laĭ, wơ̆t ƀing ding kơna ƀing Pharisi ngă tui anŭn mơ̆n, samơ̆ ƀing ding kơna ih ƀơ̆ng huă laih anŭn mơñum.”
And he said to them, Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast when the bridegroom is with them? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Dưi mơ̆ ƀing gih ngă brơi ƀing arăng jak kơ tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă dŏ rơkơi bơnai ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă tơdang han tao ăt dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu?

And he spoke also a parable to them: No one puts a piece of a new garment upon an old garment, otherwise he will both rend the new, and the piece which is from the new will not suit with the old. @ Yêsu ăt pơhiăp tơlơi bơhmutu kơ ƀing gơñu: “Arăng ƀu hek ôh sa pŏk bơnal mơ̆ng ao phrâo kiăng sĭt tĕp hăng ao so.

And no one puts new wine into old skins, otherwise the new wine will burst the skins, and it will be poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; @ Laih anŭn arăng ƀu pioh ôh tơpai phrâo amăng get klĭ so, tơdah ngă tui anŭn tơpai phrâo či blôk pơčah klĭ so anŭn, tơpai či hŏk hĭ laih anŭn kơdŭng klĭ či răm mơ̆n. 
but new wine is to be put into new skins, and both are preserved. @ Samơ̆ arăng pioh tơpai phrâo amăng get klĭ phrâo.

And it came to pass on [the] second-first sabbath, that he went through cornfields, and his disciples were plucking the ears and eating [them], rubbing [them] in their hands. @ Sa hrơi Saƀat Yêsu găn hmua pơdai blê. Ƀing ding kơna Ñu ruač amŭng pơdai, pơpao hăng tơngan gơñu laih anŭn ƀơ̆ng. 
But some of the Pharisees said to them, Why do ye what is not lawful to do on the sabbath? @ Hmâo đơđa ƀing Pharisi laĭ: “Hyư̆m ƀing gih ngă tơlơi arăng ƀu dưi ngă ôh amăng hrơi Saƀat?”
And Jesus answering said to them, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did when he hungered, he and those who were with him, @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih aka đŏk ôh hă hơgĕt tơlơi Đawit hmâo ngă laih tơdang ñu hăng ƀing đuaĭ tui ñu rơpa? 
how he entered into the house of God and took the shewbread and ate, and gave to those also who were with him, which it is not lawful that [any] eat, unless the priests alone? @ Ñu mŭt amăng sang Ơi Adai, mă ƀơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng pơyơr kơ Ơi Adai, laih anŭn brơi kơ ƀing nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu ƀơ̆ng mơ̆n.

And he said to them, The Son of man is Lord of the sabbath also. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ană Mơnuih jing Khua kơ hrơi Saƀat.”
And it came to pass on another sabbath also that he entered into the synagogue and taught; and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered. @ Sa hrơi Saƀat pơkŏn, Yêsu mŭt amăng sang bơjơnum laih anŭn pơtô laĭ. Pơ anŭn hmâo sa čô mơnuih tơngan gah hơnuă ñu jo. 
And the scribes and the Pharisees were watching if he would heal on the sabbath, that they might find something of which to accuse him. @ Ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt laih anŭn ƀing Pharisi krăp lăng sŭ Yêsu thâo dah Ñu či pơsuaih mơ̆ amăng hrơi Saƀat, kiăng kơ hmâo tơlơi phong kơ Ñu. 
But *he* knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, Get up, and stand in the midst. And having risen up he stood [there]. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu thâo tơlơi pơmĭn gơñu laih anŭn laĭ kơ mơnuih jo tơngan: “Rai dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anai.” Ñu tơgŭ hăng dŏ dơ̆ng pơ anŭn. 
Jesus therefore said to them, I will ask you if it is lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy [it]? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Kâo tơña ƀing gih: Hơgĕt tơlơi juăt tŭ ư brơi ƀing ta dưi ngă amăng hrơi Saƀat, ngă bruă hiam ƀôdah ngă bruă sat, pơklaih mơnuih ƀôdah pơdjai mơnuih?” 
And having looked around on them all, he said to him, Stretch out thy hand. And he did [so] and his hand was restored as the other. @ Yêsu lăng kơ abih bang ƀing jum dar laih anŭn laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Yơr tơngan ih bĕ.” Gơ̆ yơr, laih anŭn tơngan ñu suaih mơtam.

And when it was day he called his disciples, and having chosen out twelve from them, whom also he named apostles: @ Tơ mơguah hrơi tơdơi, Yêsu iâu ƀing ding kơna Ñu laih anŭn ruah mă pluh dua čô mơ̆ng ƀing gơñu. Kơ ƀing anŭn Ñu pia jing khua ding kơna:

and having descended with them, he stood on a level place, and a crowd of his disciples, and a great multitude of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; @ Yêsu trŭn hrŏm hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu laih anŭn dŏ ƀơi sa anih lŏn daŏ.

And the Lord, seeing her, was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, Weep not; @ Tơ Khua Yang ƀuh đah kơmơi anŭn, Ñu hmâo tơlơi glưh pran jua hăng pap drap kơ gơ̆, hnŭn yơh Ñu laĭ: “Anăm hia ôh.”

And fear seized on all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has been raised up amongst us; and God has visited his people. @ Abih bang mơnuih hwĭ biă mă, laih anŭn gơñu pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai, hăng laĭ: “Sa čô pô laĭ lui hlâo prŏng truh laih tơ̆ng krah ƀing ta,” laih anŭn “Ơi Adai hmâo rai čuă laih ƀing ană plei pla Ñu.” 
And this report went out in all Judaea concerning him, and in all the surrounding country. @ Arăng ră ruai tơlơi Yêsu ngă anai tar ƀar čar Yuđa laih anŭn abih tring jum dar.
And the disciples of John brought him word concerning all these things: @ Ƀing ding kơna Yôhan ruai glaĭ kơ Yôhan abih tơlơi anŭn. Yôhan iâu dua čô ding kơna ñu, 
and John, having called two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art *thou* he that is coming, or are we to wait for another? @ laih anŭn pơkiaŏ gơñu nao tơña Khua Yang: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ Ih jing Pô khŏm rai, ƀôdah gơmơi či dŏ tơguan pô pơkŏn?”

In that hour he healed many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and to many blind he granted sight. @ Ƀơi mông anŭn Yêsu pơsuaih lu mơnuih ruă duăm, mơnuih yang sat ngă, laih anŭn Ñu ngă brơi lu mơnuih bum mơta dưi ƀuh rơđah. 
And Jesus answering said to them, Go, bring back word to John of what ye have seen and heard: that blind see, lame walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf hear, dead are raised, poor are evangelized; @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Nao ruai glaĭ bĕ kơ Yôhan hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih hmâo ƀuh laih anŭn hmư̆ laih: ƀing bum mơta dưi ƀuh rơđah dơ̆ng, ƀing rơwen tơkai thâo rơbat, ƀing djơ̆ phŭng dưi rơgoh, ƀing tơngil dưi hmư̆, ƀing djai hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng, laih anŭn ƀing ƀun rin dưi hmư̆ Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam.

And the messengers of John having departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken by the wind? @ Tơ ƀing Yôhan pơkiaŏ nao glaĭ laih, Yêsu čơdơ̆ng pơhiăp kơ ƀing lu tơlơi djơ̆ kơ Yôhan: “Ƀing gih nao lăng tơlơi hơgĕt amăng tơdrŏn tač?

for I say unto you, Among them that are born of women a greater [prophet] is no one than John [the baptist]; but he who is a little one in the kingdom of God is greater than he. @ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, đơ ƀing mơnuih đah kơmơi tơkeng rai laih, ƀu hmâo pô prŏng hloh kơ Yôhan ôh; samơ̆ pô anĕt hloh amăng dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai jing pô prŏng hloh kơ Yôhan.” 
(And all the people who heard [it], and the tax-gatherers, justified God, having been baptised with the baptism of John; @ Abih bang ƀing ană plei pla wơ̆t ƀing ring jia hmư̆ Yôhan pơtô, hmâo tŭ laih tơlơi ƀatem Yôhan, gơñu leng tŭ ư kơ Ơi Adai jing tơpă.

To whom therefore shall I liken the men of this generation, and to whom are they like? @ “Hăng tơlơi hơgĕt Kâo či pơhmu ƀing mơnuih rơnŭk anai lĕ, laih anŭn gơñu hrup hăng hlơi? 
They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. @ Gơñu jing hrup hăng ƀing čơđai dŏ ber amăng anih sĭ mơdrô, laih anŭn gơñu pơ iâu tơdruă gơñu tui anai: ‘Gơmơi ayŭp laih đing dĕk kơ ƀing gih, samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu yŭn suang ôh; gơmơi hri čok laih, samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu hia ôh.’ 
For John the baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon. @ Yua kơ Yôhan Ƀatem rai laih, ƀu ƀơ̆ng huă, laih anŭn ƀu mơñum tơpai ôh, anŭn yơh ƀing gih laĭ: ‘Ñu yang sat ngă.’

and wisdom has been justified of all her children. @ Samơ̆ tơlơi kơhnâo pơsĭt ñu pô jing djơ̆ yua mơ̆ng boh than ñu.”
But one of the Pharisees begged him that he would eat with him. And entering into the house of the Pharisee he took his place at table; @ Sa čô Pharisi jak Yêsu ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hăng ñu, Yêsu mŭt amăng sang pô anŭn laih anŭn dŏ ber ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hăng ñu. 
and behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, and knew that he was sitting at meat in the house of the Pharisee, having taken an alabaster box of myrrh, @ Laih anŭn anai nê, hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi soh sat amăng plei anŭn, tơ ñu thâo Yêsu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă amăng sang sa čô mơnuih Pharisi, ñu djă ba sa boh get boh pơtâo hiam pioh bă hăng ia klôñ ƀâu mơngưi. 
and standing at his feet behind [him] weeping, began to wash his feet with tears; and she wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the myrrh. @ Ñu dŏ gah klon ƀơi tơkai Yêsu, ñu hia, ia mơta ñu ngă pơsah tơkai Yêsu; giơ̆ng anŭn ñu sut tơkai Yêsu hăng ƀuk ñu.

And the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spoke with himself saying, This [person] if he were a prophet would have known who and what the woman is who touches him, for she is a sinner. @ Mơnuih Pharisi, pô jak Yêsu ƀuh tơlơi anŭn, ñu pơmĭn tui anai: “Tơdah pô anai jing sa čô pô laĭ lui hlâo sĭt, Ñu thâo krăn yơh hlơi đah kơmơi pô ruaih Ñu anai laih anŭn hyư̆m gơ̆ jing, yua kơ gơ̆ jing sa čô mơnuih soh.”
And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he says, Teacher, say [it]. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ Simôn, Kâo hmâo tơlơi kiăng pơhiăp hăng ih.” Ñu laĭ: “Ơ nai, pơhiăp bĕ!”
There were two debtors of a certain creditor: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty; @ “Sa čô mơnuih hmâo dua čô đom hơnưh ñu. Sa čô đom hơnưh rơma rơtuh đơniê laih anŭn sa čô pơkŏn rơma pluh đơniê. 
but as they had nothing to pay, he forgave both of them [their debt]: [say,] which of them therefore will love him most? @ Yua kơ dua gơñu ƀu dưi kla ôh, pô hơnưh pơrơngai hĭ hơnưh gơñu. Tui anŭn hlơi amăng dua gơñu či khăp kơ pô hơnưh lu hloh?”
And Simon answering said, I suppose he to whom he forgave the most. And he said to him, Thou hast rightly judged. @ Simôn laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo pơmĭn pô ñu pơrơngai hơnưh lu hloh anŭn.” Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ih pơmĭn djơ̆ yơh.”
And turning to the woman he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house; thou gavest me not water on my feet, but *she* has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair. @ Laih anŭn Ñu wir lăng đah kơmơi anŭn hăng laĭ kơ Simôn: “Ih ƀuh mơ̆ đah kơmơi anai?

For which cause I say to thee, Her many sins are forgiven; for she loved much; but he to whom little is forgiven loves little. @ Hnŭn yơh Kâo laĭ kơ ih tơlơi soh gơ̆ lu biă mă samơ̆ hmâo tơlơi pap brơi laih, yua kơ anŭn yơh gơ̆ khăp lu. Samơ̆ kơ pô hmâo tơlơi pap brơi ƀiă, ñu khăp ƀiă.”
And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven. @ Laih anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ đah kơmơi anŭn: “Tơlơi soh ih Kâo pap brơi laih.”
And they that were with [them] at table began to say within themselves, Who is this who forgives also sins? @ Tui anŭn ƀing dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hăng Ñu čơdơ̆ng bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu pô: “Hlơi pô anai, tơl Ñu dưi pap brơi tơlơi soh arăng?”
And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ đah kơmơi anŭn: “Tơlơi đaŏ ih pơklaih ih laih; nao rơnŭk rơnua bĕ.”
And it came to pass afterwards that *he* went through [the country] city by city, and village by village, preaching and announcing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God; and the twelve [were] with him, @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Yêsu găn nao plei prŏng laih anŭn plei anĕt, pơhaih hăng pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam Dêh Čar Pơtao Ơi Adai.

and certain women who had been healed of wicked spirits and infirmities, Mary who was called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, @ Laih anŭn ăt hmâo mơ̆n ƀing đah kơmơi nao hrŏm hăng Ñu, jing ƀing mơnuih Yêsu hmâo suaih laih mơ̆ng tơlơi yang sat ngă laih anŭn tơlơi duăm ruă: HʼMari Madala, mơ̆ng ñu yơh tơjuh čô yang sat tơbiă laih,

And a great crowd coming together, and those who were coming to him out of each city, he spoke by parable: @ Tơ ƀing mơnuih lu pơtŭm glaĭ, laih anŭn ƀing ană plei mơ̆ng lu boh plei phara rai pơ Ñu, Yêsu pơhiăp hăng tơlơi bơhmutu, 
The sower went out to sow his seed; and as he sowed, some fell along the way, and it was trodden under foot, and the birds of the heaven devoured it up; @ “Sa čô mơnuih sai pơjeh nao sai pơjeh ñu. Tơdang ñu sai đơđa pơjeh lĕ kơtuai jơlan. Arăng juă laih anŭn čĭm čoh ƀơ̆ng hĭ pơjeh anŭn. 
and other fell upon the rock, and having sprung up, it was dried up because it had not moisture; @ Đơđa lĕ ƀơi ngŏ boh pơtâo. Pơjeh anŭn man čăt, ñu gliu hĭ yua kơ ƀu hmâo hyuh ia ôh. 
and other fell in the midst of the thorns, and the thorns having sprung up with [it] choked it; @ Đơđa lĕ amăng anih drơi, drơi čăt hrŏm laih anŭn ket hĭ pơdai anŭn. 
and other fell into the good ground, and having sprung up bore fruit a hundredfold. As he said these things he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear. @ Hmâo đơđa pơjeh pơkŏn dơ̆ng lĕ amăng anih lŏn hiam, ñu čăt đĭ hăng mơboh sa asar jing sa rơtuh.” Giơ̆ng Ñu pơhiăp tui anŭn, Ñu laĭ kraih: “Hlơi pô hmâo tơngia thâo hmư̆, brơi ñu hmư̆ bĕ!”
And his disciples asked him [saying], What may this parable be? @ Tơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu tơña Ñu hơgĕt tơlơi kiăng pia kơ tơlơi bơhmutu anŭn, 
And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest in parables, in order that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand. @ Ñu laĭ: “Ơi Adai pha brơi kơ ƀing gih dưi thâo hluh tơlơi yom hơgơ̆m kơ Dêh Čar Pơtao Ơi Adai; Samơ̆ kơ ƀing pơkŏn Kâo pơhiăp kơ gơñu hăng tơlơi bơhmutu, kiăng kơ
Gơñu lăng samơ̆ gơñu ƀu thâo ƀuh ôh,

But the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. @ “Anai tơlơi bơhmutu anŭn kiăng pia: pơjeh jing boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai. 
But those by the wayside are those who hear; then comes the devil and takes away the word from their heart that they may not believe and be saved. @ Pơjeh lĕ kơtuai jơlan jing ƀing hmư̆ boh pơhiăp, samơ̆ yang sat rai hăng mă hĭ pơjeh mơ̆ng pran jua gơñu, hwĭ kơ gơñu đaŏ laih anŭn hmâo hĭ tơlơi pơklaih. 
But those upon the rock, those who when they hear receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a time, and in time of trial fall away. @ Pơjeh lĕ ƀơi boh pơtâo jing ƀing hmư̆ boh pơhiăp laih anŭn mă tŭ mơtam hăng tơlơi mơak, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu hmâo akha ôh.

And no one having lighted a lamp covers it with a vessel or puts it under a couch, but sets it on a lamp-stand, that they who enter in may see the light. @ “Ƀu hmâo ôh hlơi čuh apui kơđen laih anŭn gom hĭ ñu hăng kơthŭng ƀôdah pioh ñu gah yŭ sưng pĭt, samơ̆ pioh ñu ƀơi gơ̆ng apui kơđen, kiăng kơ hlơi pô mŭt amăng sang dưi ƀuh tơlơi bơngač.

But he answering said to them, My mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do [it]. @ Samơ̆ Ñu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Hlơi pô hmư̆ tơlơi Ơi Adai pơhiăp laih anŭn ngă tui, ƀing anŭn jing amĭ Kâo laih anŭn ƀing adơi ayŏng Kâo.”
And it came to pass on one of the days, that *he* entered into a ship, himself and his disciples; and he said to them, Let us pass over to the other side of the lake; and they set off from shore. @ Sa hrơi anŭn, Yêsu đĭ amăng sa boh sŏng hrŏm hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu.

And as they sailed, he fell asleep; and a sudden squall of wind came down on the lake, and they were filled [with water], and were in danger; @ Tơdang sŏng gơñu nao, Yêsu pĭt hĭ. Hmâo rơbŭ kơthel truh ƀơi ia dơnao, laih anŭn ia mŭt bă sŏng, laih anŭn gơñu hlăk bưp tơlơi hyưt pưt. 
and coming to [him] they woke him up, saying, Master, master, we perish. But he, rising up, rebuked the wind and the raging of the water; and they ceased, and there was a calm. @ Gơñu nao râo Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Ơ Nai, Ơ Nai, ƀing ta djai yơh!” Yêsu mơdưh, khă angĭn hăng ia pah pŭng.

And he said to them, Where is your faith? And, being afraid, they were astonished, saying to one another, Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu “Pơpă tơlơi đaŏ ƀing gih lĕ?” Gơñu hwĭ, hling hlang laih anŭn bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu: “Hlơi pô anai, tơl wơ̆t angĭn laih anŭn ia pah pŭng ăt gưt kơ Ñu mơ̆n?”
And they arrived in the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. @ Gơñu truh pơ tring Gêrasen klă anăp tring Galilê. 
And as he got out [of the ship] on the land, a certain man out of the city met him, who had demons a long time, and put on no clothes, and did not abide in a house, but in the tombs. @ Tơdang Yêsu man tơbiă trŭn ƀơi hang, hmâo sa čô mơnuih mơ̆ng plei hmâo lu yang sat ngă nao bưp Ñu.

But seeing Jesus, he cried out, and fell down before him, and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus Son of the Most High God?

For he had commanded the unclean spirit to go out from the man. For very often it had seized him; and he had been bound, kept with chains and fetters; and breaking the bonds he was driven by the demon into the deserts. @ Yua kơ Yêsu hmâo pơđar laih yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak brơi ñu tơbiă mơ̆ng mơnuih anŭn.

But they that fed [them], seeing what had happened, fled, and told [it] to the city and to the country. @ Tơ ƀing wai bơbui ƀuh tơlơi truh, gơñu đuaĭ kơdŏp hăng ră tơlơi anŭn djŏp plei pla amăng tring anŭn. 
And they went out to see what had happened, and came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting, clothed and sensible, at the feet of Jesus. And they were afraid. @ Tui anŭn ƀing ană plei pla tơbiă nao kiăng lăng tơlơi truh anŭn. Gơñu truh pơ Yêsu, laih anŭn ƀuh mơnuih ƀing yang sat hmâo tơbiă đuaĭ laih.

And all the multitude of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were possessed with great fear; and *he*, entering into the ship, returned. @ Tui anŭn abih bang ƀing ană plei pla jum dar tring Gêrasen rơkâo kơ Yêsu đuaĭ hĭ mơ̆ng gơñu, yua kơ gơñu hwĭ biă mă.

But the man out of whom the demons had gone besought him that he might be with him. But he sent him away, saying, @ Mơnuih hmâo ƀing yang sat phrâo tơbiă anŭn kơwưh kiăng dưi dŏ hrŏm hăng Yêsu. Samơ̆ Yêsu brơi ñu glaĭ hăng laĭ,

And Jesus said, Who has touched me? But all denying, Peter and those with him said, Master, the crowds close thee in and press upon thee, and sayest thou, Who has touched me? @ Laih anŭn Yêsu tơña: “Hlơi ruaih Kâo?” Tơdang abih bang mơnuih hơngah, Pêtrôs laih anŭn ƀing hrŏm hăng ñu laĭ: “Ơ Nai, ƀing mơnuih lu jum dar Ih, gơñu kơpĭ Ih.”
And Jesus said, Some one has touched me, for *I* have known that power has gone out from me. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ: “Hmâo sa čô mơnuih ruaih laih Kâo, yua kơ Kâo thâo tơlơi dưi mơyang tơbiă laih mơ̆ng Kâo.” 
And the woman, seeing that she was not hid, came trembling, and falling down before him declared before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how she was immediately healed. @ Tơ đah kơmơi anŭn thâo kơ ñu ƀu dưi pơdŏp ôh, ñu tơtư̆ drơi jan glung nao bon ƀơi tơkai Yêsu, laih anŭn pơhaih ƀơi anăp abih bang mơnuih yua hơgĕt gơ̆ hmâo ruaih laih ao Yêsu laih anŭn hyư̆m gơ̆ suaih mơtam. 
And he said to her, [Be of good courage,] daughter; thy faith has healed thee; go in peace. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Ơ mŏ, tơlơi đaŏ ih hmâo pơsuaih ih laih. Nao rơnŭk rơnua bĕ!”
While he was yet speaking, comes some one from the ruler of the synagogue, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; do not trouble the teacher. @ Tơdang Ñu ăt dŏ pơhiăp, hmâo sa čô rai mơ̆ng sang khua wai sang bơjơnum laih anŭn laĭ: “Ană đah kơmơi ih djai laih, anăm pơgŭn Nai dơ̆ng ôh.”

And when he came to the house he suffered no one to go in but Peter and John and James and the father of the child and the mother. @ Tơ Yêsu truh pơ sang, Ñu ƀu brơi sa čô mŭt hrŏm hăng Ñu ôh, kơnơ̆ng Pêtrôs, Yôhan, Yakơ, laih anŭn amĭ ama čơđai anŭn. 
And all were weeping and lamenting her. But he said, Do not weep, for she has not died, but sleeps. @ Abih bang hlăk dŏ čŏk hia rơngot kơ đah kơmơi anŭn; samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ: “Anăm čŏk hia ôh, yua kơ gơ̆ ƀu djai ôh, samơ̆ gơ̆ dŏ pĭt đôč.”
And they derided him, knowing that she had died. @ Ƀing anŭn klao mưč kơ Yêsu, yua kơ gơñu thâo čơđai anŭn djai laih. 
But *he*, having turned them all out and taking hold of her hand, cried saying, Child, arise. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu djă tơngan gơ̆ hăng laĭ: “Ơ mŏ, tơgŭ bĕ.” 
And her spirit returned, and immediately she rose up; and he commanded [something] to eat to be given to her. @ Bơngăt gơ̆ wơ̆t glaĭ pơ gơ̆ dơ̆ng laih anŭn gơ̆ tơgŭ mơtam. Yêsu pơđar arăng ba mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă kơ gơ̆.

And he said to them, Take nothing for the way, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; nor to have two body-coats apiece. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Anăm djă ba sa mơta gơnam hơgĕt ôh kơ tơlơi ƀing gih hyu. Anăm djă ba gai jra, kơdŭng, ƀañ tơpŭng, ƀôdah prăk ôh; laih anŭn anăm ba dua blah ao ôh. 
And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide and thence go forth. @ Sang hlơi ƀing gih mŭt, dŏ bĕ pơ anŭn tơl ƀing gih đuaĭ.

And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things which were done [by him], and was in perplexity, because it was said by some that John was risen from among [the] dead, @ Hlăk anŭn pơtao Hêrôt, pô wai lăng tring Galilê hmư̆ abih tơlơi truh laih, laih anŭn ñu rŭng răng, yua kơ ƀing anai laĭ Yôhan hơdip glaĭ laih mơ̆ng ƀing djai.

And Herod said, John *I* have beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things? and he sought to see him. @ Hêrôt laĭ: “Kâo čơ̆ng laih tơkuai Yôhan, samơ̆ hlơi pô anai kâo hmư̆ lu tơlơi ră ruai kơ ñu?” Laih anŭn Hêrôt hơduah jơlan kiăng ƀuh Yêsu.
And the apostles having returned related to him whatever they had done. And he took them and withdrew apart into [a desert place of] a city called Bethsaida. @ Tơ ƀing khua ding kơna wơ̆t glaĭ, gơñu ră ruai kơ Yêsu abih tơlơi gơñu hmâo ngă laih.

But the crowds knowing [it] followed him; and he received them and spake to them of the kingdom of God, and cured those that had need of healing. @ Tơ ƀing mơnuih lu thâo tơlơi anŭn, gơñu đuaĭ tui Yêsu.

But the day began to decline, and the twelve came and said to him, Send away the crowd that they may go into the villages around, and [into] the fields, and lodge and find victuals, for here we are in a desert place. @ Adai čơdơ̆ng klam yơh, laih anŭn ƀing pluh dua čô khua ding kơna rai laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Brơi ƀing ană plei pla glaĭ bĕ kiăng kơ gơñu nao amăng khul plei jum dar, kiăng kơ hơduah mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă laih anŭn anih pĭt đih.

And he said to them, Give *ye them to eat. And they said, We have not more than five loaves and two fishes, unless *we* should go and buy food for all this people; @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih yơh brơi mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă kơ gơñu.”

for they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in companies by fifties. @ Yua kơ pơ anai hmâo giăm rơma rơbâo čô đah rơkơi. Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Brơi gơñu dŏ ber bĕ tui hăng bôr, rĭm bôr rơma pluh čô.”
And they did so, and made them all sit down. @ Ƀing ding kơna ngă tui anŭn yơh, laih anŭn brơi abih bang ƀing gơñu dŏ ber. 
And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven he blessed them, and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the crowd. @ Yêsu mă rơma klŏ ƀañ tơpŭng hăng dua drơi akan anŭn, Ñu angak mơta pơ adai, bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai laih anŭn wơ̆k ƀañ tơpŭng, brơi kơ ƀing ding kơna pơpha brơi kơ ƀing mơnuih lu. 
And they all ate and were filled; and there was taken up of what had remained over and above to them in fragments twelve hand-baskets. @ Abih bang ƀơ̆ng laih anŭn trơi soh sel, laih anŭn gơñu duñ pơƀŭt čơđeh meh ƀañ tơpŭng, akan rơbeh anŭn bă pluh dua bai.
And it came to pass as he was praying alone, his disciples were with him, and he asked them saying, Who do the crowds say that I am? @ Sa hrơi tơdang Yêsu dŏ iâu laĭ hơjăn Ñu, ƀing ding kơna nao dŏ jum dar Ñu, Yêsu tơña kơ ƀing gơñu: “Hlơi Kâo jing tui hăng ƀing ană plei pla laĭ?”
But they answering said, John the baptist; but others, Elias; and others, that one of the old prophets has risen again. @ Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Yôhan ngă ƀatem, samơ̆ hmâo đơđa pơkŏn laĭ Êli, đơđa pơkŏn dơ̆ng laĭ sa čô amăng ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo rơnŭk đưm hơdip glaĭ.”
And he said to them, But *ye*, who do ye say that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God. @ Yêsu tơña kơ gơñu dơ̆ng: “Samơ̆ ƀing gih laĭ hlơi Kâo jing?”
Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ: “Ih jing Yang Krist mơ̆ng Ơi Adai.”
But, earnestly charging them, he enjoined [them] to say this to no man, @ Yêsu khă laih anŭn pơđar kơ ƀing gơñu anăm pơhaih tơlơi anŭn kơ arăng ôh, 
saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up. @ Ñu laĭ: “Ană Mơnuih khŏm tŭ lu tơlơi tơnap tap, mơ̆ng ƀing kŏng tha, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laih anŭn ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hơngah lui, Ñu khŏm tŭ tơlơi arăng pơdjai, truh hrơi tal klâo Ñu khŏm hơdip glaĭ.”
And he said to [them] all, If any one will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me; @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ abih bang gơñu: “Tơdah hlơi pô kiăng đuaĭ tui Kâo, brơi ñu khŏm hơngah hĭ ñu pô, rĭm hrơi glăm kơyâo bơrơkal ñu pô hăng đuaĭ tui Kâo. 
for whosoever shall desire to save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, *he* shall save it. @ Yua kơ hlơi kiăng pơklaih tơlơi hơdip ñu, ñu či rơngiă, samơ̆ hlơi pô rơngiă tơlơi hơdip ñu yua kơ Kâo ñu či hmâo glaĭ tơlơi hơdip ñu.

And it came to pass after these words, about eight days, that taking Peter and John and James he went up into a mountain to pray. @ Amăng sapăn hrơi tơdơi giơ̆ng Ñu pơhiăp khul tơlơi anŭn, Yêsu jak ba hrŏm hăng Ñu Pêtrôs, Yôhan laih anŭn Yakơ, đĭ pơ čư̆ kiăng kơ iâu laĭ.

And lo, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elias, @ Laih anŭn plŭt hmâo dua čô đah rơkơi, Môis hăng Êli dŏ pơhiăp hăng Ñu. 
who, appearing in glory, spoke of his departure which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem. @ Gơñu pơƀuh rai amăng tơlơi guh kơang laih anŭn pơhiăp kơ tơlơi Yêsu či djai, jing bruă Ñu či ngă pơsĭt pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
But Peter and those with him were oppressed with sleep: but having fully awoke up they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with him. @ Pêtrôs hăng ƀing hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu mơhao pĭt biă mă, samơ̆ tơ gơñu amlư̆ mơdưh, gơñu ƀuh tơlơi guh kơang Yêsu hăng dua čô đah rơkơi dŏ dơ̆ng hăng Ñu. 
And it came to pass as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias: not knowing what he said. @ Hlăk dua čô đah rơkơi anŭn đuaĭ mơ̆ng Yêsu, Pêtrôs laĭ hăng Ñu: “Ơ Nai, hiam yơh ƀing ta dŏ ƀơi anai; brơi gơmơi ngă klâo boh sang khăn: sa boh kơ Ih, sa kơ Môis laih anŭn sa boh kơ Êli.” Pêtrôs pơhiăp samơ̆ ƀu thâo ôh hơgĕt tơlơi ñu hlăk pơhiăp. 
But as he was saying these things, there came a cloud and overshadowed them, and they feared as they entered into the cloud: @ Tơdang Pêtrôs hlăk pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, hmâo kơthul rai gom hĭ ƀing gơñu, laih anŭn ƀing gơñu hwĭ biă mă tơdang ƀuh kơthul gom gơñu. 
and there was a voice out of the cloud saying, *This* is my beloved Son: hear him. @ Laih anŭn hmâo asăp pơhiăp mơ̆ng kơthul laĭ: “Pô anai jing ană Kâo, pô Kâo hmâo ruah laih, brơi ƀing gih dŏ hmư̆ Ñu bĕ.” 
And as the voice was [heard] Jesus was found alone: and *they* kept silence, and told no one in those days any of the things they had seen. @ Tơ asăp pơhiăp anŭn abih laih, kơnơ̆ng hơjăn Yêsu đôč dŏ ƀơi anŭn.

And lo, a man from the crowd cried out saying, Teacher, I beseech thee look upon my son, for he is mine only child: @ Laih anŭn anai nê, mơ̆ng tơ̆ng krah phung mơnuih lu sa čô đah rơkơi ur laĭ: “Ơ Nai, kâo kơwưh kơ Ih, rơkâo kơ Ih pap drap kơ ană đah rơkơi kâo đa, yua kơ kâo hmâo kơnơ̆ng sa čô anai đôč. 
and behold, a spirit takes him, and suddenly he cries out, and it tears him with foaming, and with difficulty departs from him after crushing him. @ Tơ yang sat ngă kơ ñu, tŏ tơnŏ ñu ur kraih laih anŭn yang sat hơprah añăk ñu tơl blôk ia bah, ngă pơruă gơ̆ laih anŭn gleh biă mă ñu tơbiă mơ̆ng gơ̆. 
And I besought thy disciples that they might cast him out, and they could not. @ Kâo hmâo kơwưh laih kơ ƀing ding kơna Ih puh pơđuaĭ yang sat anai, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu dưi puh pơđuaĭ ôh.”
And Jesus answering said, O unbelieving and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring hither thy son. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ kơnŭng djuai ƀu hmâo tơlơi đaŏ laih anŭn kơpĭl, hơdôm sui dơ̆ng Kâo či dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt laih anŭn gir hăng ƀing gih? Ba ană đah rơkơi ih pơ anai bĕ.”
But as he was yet coming, the demon tore him and dragged him all together. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child and gave him back to his father. @ Tơdang gơ̆ rai, yang sat hơprah gơ̆ ƀơi lŏn, laih anŭn pơkơñak gơ̆.

And all were astonished at the glorious greatness of God. And as all wondered at all the things which [Jesus] did, he said to his disciples, @ Abih bang mơnuih hling hlang kơ tơlơi dưi mơyang Ơi Adai. Tơdang abih bang dŏ hling hlang kơ abih tơlơi Yêsu hmâo ngă laih, Ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu tui anai:

But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them that they should not perceive it. And they feared to ask him concerning this saying. @ Samơ̆ ƀing ding kơna ƀu thâo hluh ôh boh pơhiăp anŭn.

And a reasoning came in amongst them, who should be [the] greatest of them. @ Ƀing ding kơna pơrơjah tơdruă gơñu kơ tơlơi hlơi pô jing prŏng hloh amăng ƀing gơñu. 
And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their heart, having taken a little child set it by him, @ Samơ̆ Yêsu thâo tơlơi pơmĭn amăng pran jua gơñu, hnŭn yơh Yêsu mă sa čô čơđai anĕt laih anŭn pioh gơ̆ ƀơi djeo Ñu,

For he who is the least among you all, *he* is great. @ laih anŭn laĭ kơ gơñu: “Hlơi pô jum čơđai anĕt anai yua kơ anăn Kâo kar hăng jum Kâo mơ̆n; laih anŭn hlơi pô jum Kâo kar hăng jum Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo laih.

And John answering said, Master, we saw some one casting out demons in thy name, and we forbad him, because he follows not with us. @ Yôhan laĭ: “Ơ Nai, gơmơi hmâo ƀuh laih sa čô mơnuih puh pơđuaĭ yang sat amăng anăn Ih, laih anŭn gơmơi khă ñu, yua kơ ñu ƀu tui ƀing ta ôh.” 
And Jesus said to him, Forbid [him] not, for he that is not against you is for you. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ Yôhan: “Anăm khă ñu ôh, yua kơ hlơi pô ƀu pơkơdơ̆ng hăng ƀing gih jing pô anŭn gah kơ ƀing gih.”
And it came to pass when the days of his receiving up were fulfilled, that *he* stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem. @ Tơ giăm truh hrơi arăng či pŭ ba Yêsu pơ adai, Ñu khư̆p ư nao pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
And he sent messengers before his face. And having gone they entered into a village of the Samaritans that they might make ready for him. @ Yêsu pơkiaŏ ƀing pô pơala nao hlâo kơ Ñu. Gơñu nao laih anŭn mŭt amăng sa boh plei ƀing Samari kiăng prăp rơmet anih kơ Yêsu. 
And they did not receive him, because his face was [turned as] going to Jerusalem. @ Samơ̆ ƀing ană plei ƀu jum Ñu ôh yua kơ gơñu thâo Yêsu anăp nao tơpă plei Yêrusalem. 
And his disciples James and John seeing [it] said, Lord, wilt thou that we speak [that] fire come down from heaven and consume them, as also Elias did? @ Tơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu Yakơ hăng Yôhan ƀuh tơlơi anŭn, gơñu laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, Ih kiăng mơ̆ gơmơi pơđar kơ apui trŭn mơ̆ng adai čuh hĭ gơñu?” 
But turning he rebuked them [and said, Ye know not of what spirit ye are]. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu wir lăng laih anŭn ƀuah kơ gơñu. 
And they went to another village. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu hlŏng nao pơ sa boh plei pơkŏn.
And it came to pass as they went in the way, one said to him, I will follow thee wheresoever thou goest, Lord. @ Tơdang gơñu rơbat rŏk jơlan, hmâo sa čô mơnuih laĭ hăng Yêsu: “Kâo či đuaĭ tui Ih pơpă anih Ih nao.”
And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven roosting-places, but the Son of man has not where he may lay his head. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Pơja hmâo amăng, čĭm amăng adai hmâo hruh, samơ̆ Ană Mơnuih ƀu hmâo anih đăl akŏ ôh.”
And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me to go first and bury my father. @ Yêsu laĭ hăng sa čô pô pơkŏn: “Đuaĭ tui Kâo bĕ.” Samơ̆ ñu laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, brơi kâo glaĭ dơr hĭ ama kâo hlâo amơĭ.”
But Jesus said to him, Suffer the dead to bury their own dead, but do *thou* go and announce the kingdom of God. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Lui ƀing djai dơr mă ƀing djai gơñu pô; bơ ih nao bĕ pơhaih Dêh Čar Pơtao Ơi Adai.”
And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord, but first allow me to bid adieu to those at my house. @ Sa čô pơkŏn laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, kâo či đuaĭ tui Ih, samơ̆ blŭng hlâo brơi kâo nao laĭ pơthâo hăng kơnŭng djuai kâo amơĭ.”
But Jesus said to him, No one having laid his hand on [the] plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Hlơi pô djă wăng čuar samơ̆ ăt dŏ lăng glaĭ pơ klon ƀu năng lăp kơ Dêh Čar Pơtao Ơi Adai ôh.”
Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn Khua Yang ruah tơjuh pluh čô ding kơna pơkŏn laih anŭn pơkiaŏ ƀing gơñu tơdua čô nao hlâo kơ Ñu amăng abih bang plei laih anŭn anih Ñu pô či nao. 
And he said to them, The harvest indeed [is] great, but the workmen few; supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest that he may send out workmen into his harvest. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Lu biă mă pơdai tơsă, samơ̆ mơnuih hơpuă ƀiă đôč. Tui anŭn, rơkâo bĕ kơ Khua pô hmua pơkiaŏ nao ƀing mă bruă nao hơpuă pơdai Ñu.

Woe to thee, Chorazin! woe to thee, Bethsaida! for if the works of power which have taken place in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they had long ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. @ “Răm ƀăm yơh kơ ih, Ơ Plei Kôrasin!

And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us through thy name. @ Tơjuh pluh čô ƀing ding kơna wơ̆t glaĭ hăng tơlơi hơ̆k mơak gơñu laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, amăng anăn Ih wơ̆t kơ ƀing yang sat ăt gưt kơ gơmơi mơ̆n!”
And he said to them, I beheld Satan as lightning falling out of heaven. @ Yêsu laĭ gơñu: “Kâo ƀuh laih satan lĕ trŭn mơ̆ng adai kar hăng kơmlă. 
Behold, I give you the power of treading upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall in anywise injure you. @ Anai nê, Kâo hmâo pha brơi laih kơ ƀing gih tơlơi dưi kiăng kơ juă hĭ ala, aguăt, laih anŭn abih tơlơi dưi kơtang pô ayăt gah yŭ tơkai ƀing gih; ƀu hmâo sa tơlơi hơgĕt dưi ngă sat kơ ƀing gih ôh.

In the same hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I praise thee, Father, Lord of the heaven and of the earth, that thou hast hid these things from wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: yea, Father, for thus has it been well-pleasing in thy sight. @ Hlăk mông anŭn, Yêsu hmâo tơlơi hơ̆k mơak mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam laih anŭn laĭ: “Ơ Ama, Khua kơ adai laih anŭn lŏn tơnah, kâo bơni hơơč kơ Ih yua kơ Ih hmâo pơdŏp laih khul tơlơi anai kơ ƀing mơnuih kơhnâo, ƀing mơnuih rơgơi, samơ̆ Ih hmâo bơrơđah laih tơlơi anai kơ ƀing čơđai anĕt.

And having turned to the disciples privately he said, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see. @ Laih anŭn Ñu wir lăng ƀing ding kơna hăng laĭ kơ hơjăn gơñu: “Mơyun hiam yơh kơ mơta dưi ƀuh tơlơi ƀing gih ƀuh ră anai! 
For I say to you that many prophets and kings have desired to see the things which ye behold, and did not see [them]; and to hear the things which ye hear, and did not hear [them]. @ Yua kơ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hmâo lu ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo laih anŭn ƀing pơtao kiăng lăng tơlơi ƀing gih ƀuh, samơ̆ ƀu ƀuh ôh, laih anŭn kiăng hmư̆ tơlơi ƀing gih hmư̆, samơ̆ ƀu hmư̆ ôh.”
And behold, a certain lawyer stood up tempting him, and saying, Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit life eternal? @ Hlăk anŭn, hmâo sa čô nai tơlơi juăt tơgŭ tơña kiăng lông lăng Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Ơ Nai, hơgĕt kâo khŏm ngă kiăng kơ dưi hmâo tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar?” 
And he said to him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Hơgĕt arăng čih laih amăng tơlơi juăt? Hơgĕt tơlơi ih ƀuh amăng anŭn?” 
But he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thine understanding; and thy neighbour as thyself. @ Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Ih khŏm khăp kơ Khua Yang Ơi Adai ih hăng abih pran jua, hăng abih bơngăt, hăng abih tơlơi kơtang, laih anŭn hăng abih tơlơi pơmĭn laih anŭn khăp kơ pô jum dar ih kar hăng kơ ih pô.” 
And he said to him, Thou hast answered right: this do and thou shalt live. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ih laĭ glaĭ djơ̆ biă mă; ngă bĕ tui anŭn laih anŭn ih či hơdip.”
But he, desirous of justifying himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour? @ Samơ̆ ñu kiăng pơrơđah pô ñu jing pô tơpă hơnơ̆ng, tui anŭn ñu laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Hlơi jing pô jum dar kâo?”
And Jesus replying said, A certain man descended from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell into [the hands of] robbers, who also, having stripped him and inflicted wounds, went away leaving him in a half-dead state. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Sa čô mơnuih đah rơkơi trŭn mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem nao pơ plei Yêrikô, gơ̆ bưp ƀing klĕ dŏp. Ƀing anŭn toh mă hĭ sum ao gơ̆, taih gơ̆ tơl djai mol laih anŭn lui hĭ gơ̆. 
And a certain priest happened to go down that way, and seeing him, passed on on the opposite side; @ Hmâo sa čô khua ngă yang rơbat ƀơi jơlan anŭn. Tơ ñu ƀuh gơ̆, ñu weh đuaĭ hĭ. 
and in like manner also a Levite, being at the spot, came and looked [at him] and passed on on the opposite side. @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n hmâo sa čô mơnuih Lêwi, tơ ñu truh ƀơi anih anŭn, ƀuh gơ̆ ñu ăt weh đuaĭ laih anŭn rơbat nao. 
But a certain Samaritan journeying came to him, and seeing [him], was moved with compassion, @ Samơ̆ hmâo sa čô mơnuih Samari rơbat ƀơi jơlan anŭn, truh giăm anih pô rơka dŏ anŭn. Tơ ñu ƀuh gơ̆, ñu hmâo tơlơi pap biă mă.

And on the morrow [as he left], taking out two denarii he gave them to the innkeeper, and said to him, Take care of him, and whatsoever thou shalt expend more, *I* will render to thee on my coming back. @ Hrơi tơdơi, ñu mă dua đơniê brơi kơ pô sang jưh hăng laĭ ‘Brơi ih wai lăng ñu, laih anŭn hơgĕt ih či pơhuač rơgao hloh dơ̆ng, tơ kâo wơ̆t glaĭ kâo či kla kơ ih dơ̆ng.’
Which [now] of these three seems to thee to have been neighbour of him who fell into [the hands of] the robbers? @ Hlơi amăng klâo čô anŭn tui hăng ih pơmĭn jing pô jum dar kơ pô bưp hăng ƀing mơnuih klĕ dŏp anŭn?”
And he said, He that shewed him mercy. And Jesus said to him, Go, and do *thou* likewise. @ Nai tơlơi juăt laĭ glaĭ: “Pô hmâo bơrơđah laih tơlơi pap drap kơ pô bưp ƀing klĕ dŏp yơh.”
Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Nao bĕ laih anŭn ngă kar hăng anŭn.”
And it came to pass as they went that *he* entered into a certain village; and a certain woman, Martha by name, received him into her house. @ Tơdang Yêsu hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu hyu pơtô. Gơñu truh pơ sa boh plei; hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi anăn gơ̆ HʼMart jak jum Ñu amăng sang gơ̆. 
And she had a sister called Mary, who also, having sat down at the feet of Jesus was listening to his word. @ Ñu hmâo sa čô adơi đah kơmơi anăn HʼMari. HʼMari dŏ ber ƀơi tơkai Khua Yang kiăng kơ hmư̆ tơlơi Ñu pơtô. 
Now Martha was distracted with much serving, and coming up she said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Speak to her therefore that she may help me. @ Samơ̆ HʼMart gŭn yua kơ hăt buih bruă.

And it came to pass as he was in a certain place praying, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, even as John also taught his disciples. @ Sa hrơi Yêsu dŏ iâu laĭ ƀơi sa anih.

And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Father, thy name be hallowed; thy kingdom come; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Tơdang ƀing gih iâu laĭ, laĭ bĕ tui anai:

And he said to them, Who among you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, let me have three loaves, @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Hlơi pô amăng ƀing gih nao pơ sang gơyut ñu krah mlam hăng rơkâo kơ ñu, hăng laĭ: ‘Ơ gơyut, brơi kâo čan klâo klŏ ƀañ tơpŭng ih,

He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters. @ Hlơi pô ƀu dŏ hrŏm hăng Kâo, ñu pơkơdơ̆ng hăng Kâo, laih anŭn hlơi pô ƀu pơgop hăng Kâo, ñu čơlah đuaĭ čơlah čơlap.”
When the unclean spirit has gone out of the man, he goes through dry places seeking rest; and not finding [any] he says, I will return to my house whence I came out. @ “Tơ yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak tơbiă laih mơ̆ng sa čô mơnuih, ñu găn nao amăng anih thu kro sem anih pơdơi; samơ̆ ƀu ƀuh anih ôh, ñu laĭ: ‘Kâo či wơ̆t glaĭ pơ sang kâo, jing anih kâo hmâo tơbiă đuaĭ laih.’ 
And having come, he finds it swept and adorned. @ Tơ ñu truh, ñu ƀuh sang anŭn arăng kih laih anŭn prăp rơmet dưm dăp hiam laih. 
Then he goes and takes seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. @ Tui anŭn ñu nao laih anŭn jak ba tơjuh čô yang sat pơkŏn sat hloh kơ ñu.

And it came to pass as he spake these things, a certain woman, lifting up her voice out of the crowd, said to him, Blessed is the womb that has borne thee, and the paps which thou hast sucked. @ Tơdang Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi mơ̆ng tơ̆ng krah mơnuih lu ur laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Mơyun hiam yơh kơ kian hmâo pi laih Ih, laih anŭn tơsâo hmâo pơmĕm Ih laih!”
But *he* said, Yea rather, blessed are they who hear the word of God and keep [it]. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ: “Ƀing hlơi hmư̆ hăng gưt boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai hmâo tơlơi mơyun hiam hloh dơ̆ng!”
But as the crowds thronged together, he began to say, This generation is a wicked generation: it seeks a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it but the sign of Jonas. @ Tơ hmâo mơnuih lu pơƀŭt glaĭ jai lu hloh dơ̆ng, Yêsu čơdơ̆ng laĭ: “Rơnŭk anai jing rơnŭk sat ƀai; gơñu hơduah sem sa gru kơnăl mơyang, samơ̆ Ơi Adai ƀu či brơi kơ gơñu sa gru kơnăl mơyang ôh, rơngiao kơ gru kơnăl mơyang Yônas. 
For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, thus shall also the Son of man be to this generation. @ Yua kơ kar hăng Yônas jing sa gru kơnăl mơyang kơ ƀing mơnuih Niniwơ, kar hăng tui anŭn mơ̆n Ană Mơnuih či jing sa gru kơnăl mơyang kơ ƀing rơnŭk anai.

But no one having lit a lamp sets it in secret, nor under the corn-measure, but on the lamp-stand, that they who enter in may see the light. @ “Ƀu hmâo ôh hlơi tuč apui kơđen pioh hĭ ƀơi anih hơgơ̆m ƀôdah pioh gah yŭ kơthŭng, samơ̆ arăng pioh ñu ƀơi gơ̆ng apui kơđen kiăng kơ hlơi pô mŭt dưi ƀuh tơlơi bơngač.

But as he spoke, a certain Pharisee asked him that he would dine with him; and entering in he placed himself at table. @ Tơ Yêsu pơhiăp giơ̆ng laih, hmâo sa čô Pharisi jak Ñu ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hăng ñu; Ñu mŭt laih anŭn dŏ ber ƀơ̆ng huă.

But the Lord said to him, Now do ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but your inward [parts] are full of plunder and wickedness. @ Hnŭn yơh, Khua Yang laĭ kơ ñu: “Ƀing Pharisi gih, pơrơgoh gah rơngiao kơčok laih anŭn jam, samơ̆ amăng lăm ƀing gih bă hăng tơlơi hưp ham laih anŭn tơlơi sat ƀai.

And one of the doctors of the law answering says to him, Teacher, in saying these things thou insultest us also. @ Sa čô amăng ƀing nai tơlơi juăt laĭ kơ Ñu: “Ơ nai, tơdang Ih pơhiăp tui anŭn Ih ƀuah wơ̆t kơ gơmơi yơh.”
And he said, To you also woe, doctors of the law, for ye lay upon men burdens heavy to bear, and yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ: “Răm ƀăm yơh wơ̆t kơ ƀing gih mơ̆n, ơ ƀing nai tơlơi juăt!

And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to press him urgently, and to make him speak of many things; @ Tơ Yêsu đuaĭ mơ̆ng anih anŭn, ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hăng ƀing Pharisi čơdơ̆ng pơkơdơ̆ng hăng Ñu kơtang tĭt laih anŭn tơña Ñu lu mơta tơlơi,

And he spoke this parable: A certain [man] had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit upon it and did not find [any]. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Ñu pơhiăp tơlơi bơhmutu anai: “Sa čô mơnuih pla sa phŭn hra amăng đang boh kơƀâu ñu. Ñu nao hơduah boh pơ anŭn, samơ̆ ƀu ƀuh ôh. 
And he said to the vinedresser, Behold, [these] three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree and find none: cut it down; why does it also render the ground useless? @ Ñu laĭ kơ pô pla phŭn boh kơƀâu: ‘Lăng bĕ, klâo thŭn laih Kâo rai hơduah boh mơ̆ng phŭn hra anai, samơ̆ Kâo ƀu ƀuh boh ôh.

But he answering says to him, Sir, let it alone for this year also, until I shall dig about it and put dung, @ Pô wai đang laĭ glaĭ: ‘Ơ khua, pioh ñu sa thŭn dơ̆ng, kâo či klơi jum dar phŭn ñu laih anŭn pioh djah.

And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. @ Amăng hrơi saƀat Yêsu dŏ pơtô amăng sang bơjơnum. 
And lo, [there was] a woman having a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and she was bent together and wholly unable to lift her head up. @ Pơ anŭn hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi yang sat ngă kơ gơ̆ rơwen amăng pluh sapăn thŭn laih. Rŏng gơ̆ gô trŭn, laih anŭn drơi jan ƀu dưi dŏ dơ̆ng tơpă dơ̆ng ôh. 
And Jesus, seeing her, called to [her], and said to her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. @ Tơ Yêsu ƀuh ñu, Ñu iâu laih anŭn laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Ơ đah kơmơi, ih klaih laih mơ̆ng ruă ih.” 
And he laid his hands upon her; and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. @ Tơ Yêsu ah tơngan ƀơi gơ̆. Tañ mơtam gơ̆ dơ̆ng tơpă glaĭ laih anŭn pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai.
But the ruler of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus healed on the sabbath, answering said to the crowd, There are six days in which [people] ought to work; in these therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. @ Samơ̆ khua wai sang bơjơnum hil yua kơ Yêsu pơsuaih amăng hrơi saƀat, laih anŭn ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ană plei: “Hmâo năm hrơi pioh mă bruă; rai bĕ amăng khul hrơi anŭn kiăng hmâo tơlơi pơsuaih, samơ̆ anăm rai ôh amăng hrơi saƀat.”
The Lord therefore answered him and said, Hypocrites! does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the manger and leading [it] away, water [it]? @ Khua Yang laĭ glaĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ ƀing plơ̆m ƀlor, amăng hrơi saƀat, ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă rĭm čô amăng ƀing gih leng kơ kleh rơmo ƀôdah aseh kle ƀing gih mơ̆ng war laih anŭn ba ñu nao mơñum ia? 
And this [woman], who is a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, lo, [these] eighteen years, ought she not to be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? @ Đah kơmơi anai jing ană Abraham, yang sat hmâo čaŏ ñu pluh sapăn thŭn laih, hyư̆m ngă ƀu dưi ôh hă yaih brơi ñu amăng hrơi Saƀat?” 
And as he said these things, all who were opposed to him were ashamed; and all the crowd rejoiced at all the glorious things which were being done by him. @ Tơ Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, abih bang ƀing ayăt Ñu mlâo hañ soh sel; laih anŭn abih bang ƀing ană plei pla hơ̆k mơak yua kơ abih bruă yom pơphan guh kơang Ñu hmâo ngă laih.
And he said, To what is the kingdom of God like? and to what shall I liken it? @ Yua kơ anŭn Yêsu laĭ: “Dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai jing kar hăng hơgĕt? Laih anŭn hăng hơgĕt Kâo či bơkơnar ñu?

The same hour certain Pharisees came up, saying to him, Get out, and go hence, for Herod is desirous to kill thee. @ Ƀơi mông anŭn hmâo ƀing Pharisi rai laĭ kơ Ñu: “Đuaĭ bĕ mơ̆ng anih anai, yua kơ Hêrôt kiăng pơdjai Ih.”

And he spoke a parable to those that were invited, remarking how they chose out the first places, saying to them, @ Tơ Yêsu ƀuh ƀing mơnuih arăng jak ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt leng kơ ruah mă anih dŏ pơpŭ yom, Ñu pơhiăp sa tơlơi bơhmutu, hăng laĭ kơ ƀing gơ̆, 
When thou art invited by any one to a wedding, do not lay thyself down in the first place at table, lest perhaps a more honourable than thou be invited by him, @ “Tơdah arăng jak ih kơ tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă dŏ rơkơi bơnai, anăm dŏ ber ôh ƀơi anih arăng pơpŭ yom, hwĭ kơ amăng ƀing ñu jak anŭn hmâo sa čô pơpŭ yom hloh kơ ih.

But when thou hast been invited, go and put thyself down in the last place, that when he who has invited thee comes, he may say to thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have honour before all that are lying at table with thee; @ Samơ̆ tơdah arăng jak ih, nao dŏ bĕ pơ anih rơnuč hloh.

And he said also to him that had invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsfolk, nor rich neighbours, lest it may be they also should invite thee in return, and a recompense be made thee. @ Yêsu ăt laĭ hăng pô jak Ñu: “Tơ ih pơkra tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă yang hrơi dơ̆ng ƀôdah klam, anăm jak ôh ƀing gơyut gơyâo ih, ƀing adơi ayŏng, ƀing kơnŭng djuai ih, ƀôdah ƀing jum dar ih pơdrŏng sah, hwĭ kơ gơñu či jak glaĭ ih dơ̆ng laih anŭn ba glaĭ kơ ih kar kaĭ mơ̆n.

And one of those that were lying at table with [them], hearing these things, said to him, Blessed [is] he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. @ Sa čô amăng ƀing dŏ ber ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hăng Yêsu hmư̆ tơlơi anai, ñu laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Mơyun hiam yơh kơ hlơi pô či dưi ƀơ̆ng huă amăng dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai!”
And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper and invited many. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Hmâo sa čô mơnuih pơkra tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă mơñum prŏng laih anŭn jak lu mơnuih. 
And he sent his bondman at the hour of supper to say to those who were invited, Come, for already all things are ready. @ Truh mông ƀơ̆ng huă, ñu pơkiaŏ nao ƀing ding kơna ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ñu jak laih: ‘Rai bĕ, yua kơ abih bang mơnơ̆ng pơkra laih.’ 
And all began, without exception, to excuse themselves. The first said to him, I have bought land, and I must go out and see it; I pray thee hold me for excused. @ Samơ̆ abih bang ƀing gơñu leng kơ hơngah soh sel.

And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee hold me for excused. @ Sa čô pơkŏn laĭ: ‘Kâo hmâo blơi rơma grop rơmo, laih anŭn kâo kiăng nao lăng gơñu. Kâo rơkâo tơlơi pap mơñai.’ 
And another said, I have married a wife, and on this account I cannot come. @ Laih anŭn pô pơkŏn dơ̆ng laĭ: ‘Kâo phrâo pơdŏ bơnai, tui anŭn kâo ƀu dưi nao ôh.’ 
And the bondman came up and brought back word of these things to his lord. Then the master of the house, in anger, said to his bondman, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring here the poor and crippled and lame and blind. @ Ding kơna anŭn wơ̆t glaĭ laih anŭn laĭ kơ khua ñu.

And the bondman said, Sir, it is done as thou hast commanded, and there is still room. @ Ding kơna laĭ: ‘Ơ khua kâo hmâo ngă laih tơlơi ih pơtă, samơ̆ ăt dŏ hmâo anih rơhông.’ 
And the lord said to the bondman, Go out into the ways and fences and compel to come in, that my house may be filled; @ Khua sang laĭ kơ ding kơna ñu: ‘Nao bĕ pơ jơlan prŏng laih anŭn jơlan anĕt gah rơngiao plei, laih anŭn pơgŏ ƀing ană plei rai mŭt kiăng kơ bă sang kâo.

And great crowds went with him; and, turning round, he said to them, @ Ƀing mơnuih lu nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu. Ñu wir glaĭ lăng hăng laĭ kơ ƀing gơñu: 
If any man come to me, and shall not hate his own father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters, yea, and his own life too, he cannot be my disciple; @ “Tơdah hlơi pô đuaĭ tui Kâo samơ̆ ƀu bơrơmŭt ôh kơ amĭ ama, kơ ană bơnai, kơ ƀing ayŏng amai adơi, laih anŭn wơ̆t kơ tơlơi hơdip ñu pô, ñu ƀu dưi jing ding kơna Kâo ôh.

For which of you, desirous of building a tower, does not first sit down and count the cost, if he have what [is needed] to complete it; @ Tơdah hlơi pô amăng ƀing gih kiăng ngă sang rơñan, blŭng hlâo ƀu dŏ ber kiăng tĭng lăng nua ñu kiăng kơ thâo ñu dưi ngă pơgiơ̆ng mơ̆ sang rơñan anŭn?

saying, This man began to build and was not able to finish? @ ‘Mơnuih anai čơdơ̆ng ngă sang, samơ̆ ñu ƀu dưi ngă pơgiơ̆ng ôh.’ 
Or what king, going on his way to engage in war with another king, does not, sitting down first, take counsel whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him coming against him with twenty thousand? @ Ƀôdah hmâo mơ̆ pơtao tơdang ñu nao pơblah hăng sa čô pơtao pơkŏn, samơ̆ ƀu dŏ ber črŏng sai hlâo ôh kiăng thâo ñu djă ba pluh rơbâo tơhan dưi mơ̆ pơblah hăng pơtao hmâo dua pluh rơbâo tơhan?

Salt [then] [is] good, but if the salt also has become savourless, wherewith shall it be seasoned? @ “Hra jing mơnơ̆ng hiam, samơ̆ tơdah ñu rơngiă hĭ mơnâo mơsĭn ñu, hăng hơgĕt arăng či ngă ñu mơsĭn glaĭ dơ̆ng?

And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming near to him to hear him; @ Hlăk anŭn abih bang ƀing ring jia laih anŭn ƀing mơnuih soh nao giăm Yêsu kiăng hmư̆ tơlơi Ñu pơtô.

And he spoke to them this parable, saying, @ Yua kơ anŭn, Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi bơhmutu anai kơ gơñu: 
What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost, until he find it? @ “Hmâo hlơi mơ̆ amăng ƀing gih hmâo sa rơtuh drơi triu, tơdah rơngiă hĭ sa drơi, ñu ƀu lui hĭ ôh dua rơpăn pluh dua rơpăn drơi pơkŏn amăng tơdrŏn tač kiăng kơ nao sem sa drơi rơngiă laih tơl ƀuh ñu? 
and having found it, he lays it upon his own shoulders, rejoicing; @ Tơ gơ̆ ƀuh ñu laih, gơ̆ glăm ñu ƀơi bra hăng tơlơi hơ̆k mơak. 
and being come to the house, calls together the friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep. @ Laih anŭn tơ ñu truh pơ sang, ñu iâu pơƀŭt ƀing giăng mah laih anŭn ƀing jum dar ñu hăng laĭ kơ gơñu: ‘Hơ̆k mơak bĕ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng kâo yua kơ kâo ƀuh glaĭ laih triu rơngiă anŭn.’ 
I say unto you, that thus there shall be joy in heaven for one repenting sinner, [more] than for ninety and nine righteous who have no need of repentance. @ Ăt tui anŭn mơ̆n, Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih amăng adai či hmâo tơlơi hơ̆k mơak kơ sa čô mơnuih soh kơhmal tơlơi soh hloh kơ dua rơpăn pluh dua rơpăn čô mơnuih tơpă ƀu kiăng khŏm kơhmal tơlơi soh ôh.”
Or, what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it? @ “Ƀôdah hmâo mơ̆ sa čô đah kơmơi hmâo pluh sar prăk kak, tơdah rơngiă hĭ sa asar, ñu ƀu čuh apui kơđen, kih sang laih anŭn sem hăng abih pran jua tơl ñu ƀuh? 
and having found it she calls together the friends and neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost. @ Laih anŭn tơ ñu ƀuh glaĭ prăk anŭn, ñu iâu pơƀŭt ƀing giăng mah laih anŭn ƀing jum dar hăng laĭ: ‘Hơ̆k mơak bĕ hrŏm hăng kâo, yua kơ kâo ƀuh glaĭ laih prăk kak rơngiă anŭn.’ 
Thus, I say unto you, there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner. @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n, Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih thâo, ƀing ling jang hiam Ơi Adai mơak biă mă yua kơ sa čô mơnuih soh kơhmal tơlơi soh ñu.”
And he said, A certain man had two sons; @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu ruai dơ̆ng: “Sa čô mơnuih hmâo dua čô ană đah rơkơi. 
and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give to me the share of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided to them what he was possessed of. @ Pô adơi laĭ hăng ama ñu: ‘Ơ ama, rơkâo ih pơpha brơi kâo črăn kong ngăn lơ̆m kơ kâo.’ Laih anŭn ama gơñu pơpha brơi kong ngăn kơ dua gơñu. 
And after not many days the younger son gathering all together went away into a country a long way off, and there dissipated his property, living in debauchery. @ Ƀu sui ôh mơ̆ng anŭn, adơi ñu mă abih gơnam ñu hmâo laih anŭn nao pơ sa boh čar ataih.

But when he had spent all there arose a violent famine throughout that country, and he began to be in want. @ Tơ ñu pơplai hĭ abih gơnam laih, tơlơi ư̆ rơpa prŏng truh amăng čar anŭn, laih anŭn ñu čơdơ̆ng kơƀah kơƀap. 
And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. @ Tui anŭn ñu khŏm nao mă bruă kơ sa čô mơnuih amăng čar anŭn. Pô anŭn pơkiaŏ ñu nao wai bơbui pơ tơdrŏn glai. 
And he longed to fill his belly with the husks which the swine were eating; and no one gave to him. @ Ñu kiăng biă mă ƀơ̆ng kơđuh rơtak arăng čem bơbui, samơ̆ arăng ƀu brơi ñu ƀơ̆ng sa mơta mơnơ̆ng hơgĕt ôh. 
And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have abundance of bread, and *I* perish here by famine. @ Hlăk anŭn ñu hơdơr glaĭ, ñu laĭ amăng pran jua ñu: ‘Hmâo lu ƀing mơnuih mă bruă apah amăng sang ama kâo, gơñu hmâo djŏp ƀañ tơpŭng ƀơ̆ng laih anŭn rơbeh rơbai, samơ̆ kâo pơ anai či djai rơwet. 
I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee; @ Kâo či tơgŭ hăng glaĭ pơ ama kâo, laih anŭn kâo či laĭ hăng ñu: “Ơ Ama, kâo hmâo ngă soh laih hăng adai laih anŭn hăng ih.

And he rose up and went to his own father. But while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck, and covered him with kisses. @ Hnŭn yơh ñu tơgŭ mơtam glaĭ pơ ama ñu. Samơ̆ tơdang ñu ăt dŏ pơ ataih, ama ñu ƀuh ñu, glưh pran jua pap drap, đuaĭ nao kuar mă hăng čŭm ñu. 
And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son. @ Laih anŭn ană đah rơkơi ñu laĭ hăng ñu: ‘Ơ Ama, kâo hmâo ngă soh glaĭ laih hăng adai laih anŭn hăng ih. Kâo ƀu lăp ôh ih iâu kâo ană ih dơ̆ng.’ 
But the father said to his bondmen, Bring out the best robe and clothe him in [it], and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet; @ Samơ̆ ama ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna ñu: ‘Mă rai tañ bĕ ao phyung hiam hloh buh brơi ñu, čŭt rơbưn ƀơi čơđeng ñu, laih anŭn čŭt brơi čơkhŏ ƀơi tơkai ñu.

And his elder son was in the field; and as, coming [up], he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. @ “Hlăk anŭn ană kơčoa ñu dŏ pơ hmua. Tơ ñu glaĭ giăm truh pơ sang, ñu hmư̆ asăp gong, adoh laih anŭn tơlơi yŭn suang. 
And having called one of the servants, he inquired what these things might be. @ Ñu iâu sa čô amăng ding kơna laih anŭn tơña hơgĕt tơlơi anŭn. 
And he said to him, Thy brother is come, and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and well. @ Ding kơna anŭn laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Adơi ih hmâo glaĭ laih, laih anŭn ama ih hmâo čuh ană rơmo rơmŏng, yua kơ ƀuh gơ̆ glaĭ hiam drơi jan suaih prăl.’

But he answering said to his father, Behold, so many years I serve thee, and never have I transgressed a commandment of thine; and to me hast thou never given a kid that I might make merry with my friends: @ Samơ̆ ñu laĭ hăng ama ñu: ‘Ơ ama lăng bĕ, sui thŭn laih kâo mă bruă kơ ih, kâo aka rơgao djơ̆ ôh asăp ih pơđar, samơ̆ ih ƀu brơi amơĭ kơ kâo sa drơi ană bơbe kiăng kơ kâo ngă tơlơi hơ̆k mơak hăng ƀing giăng mah kâo.

But he said to him, Child, *thou* art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine. @ Ama ñu laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Ơ dăm, ih dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng kâo nanao, laih anŭn abih bang gơnam kâo hmâo jing gơnam ih. 
But it was right to make merry and rejoice, because this thy brother was dead and has come to life again, and was lost and has been found. @ Samơ̆ lăp yơh ngă tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă laih anŭn hơ̆k mơak, yua kơ adơi ih anai djai laih, samơ̆ ră anai ñu hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng; ñu rơngiă laih, samơ̆ ră anai ƀuh glaĭ dơ̆ng.’”
And he said also to [his] disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and *he* was accused to him as wasting his goods. @ Yêsu laĭ dơ̆ng kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Sa čô mơnuih pơdrŏng anŭn hmâo sa čô pô wai lăng sang ñu, arăng phong kơ ñu hmâo pơprŏt pơrai hĭ kong ngăn khua ñu. 
And having called him, he said to him, What [is] this that I hear of thee? give the reckoning of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer steward. @ Tui anŭn, khua anŭn iâu ñu laih anŭn laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Hơgĕt tơlơi ih hmâo ngă laih, kâo hmư̆ arăng phong kơ ih?

And the steward said within himself, What shall I do; for my lord is taking the stewardship from me? I am not able to dig; I am ashamed to beg. @ Pô wai lăng sang anŭn laĭ amăng pran jua: ‘Khua kâo khăt bruă kâo wai lăng sang ñu, hơgĕt kâo či ngă?

I know what I will do, that when I shall have been removed from the stewardship I may be received into their houses. @ Kâo thâo laih hơgĕt kâo khŏm ngă kiăng kơ hmâo mơnuih jum kâo mŭt amăng sang gơñu, tơ khua kâo khăt bruă kâo.’ 
And having called to [him] each one of the debtors of his own lord, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord? @ Tui anŭn, ñu iâu mă hơjăn rĭm čô ƀing đom hơnưh kơ khua ñu, laih anŭn tơña kơ pô blŭng hlâo: ‘Hơdôm ih đom hơnưh kơ khua kâo?’ 
And he said, A hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take thy writing and sit down quickly and write fifty. @ Gơ̆ laĭ: ‘Sa rơtuh kơthŭng ia luil ôliwơ.’ Ñu laĭ kơ gơ̆: ‘Mă hră hơnưh ih, dŏ ber tañ laih anŭn čih glaĭ rơma pluh.’ 
Then he said to another, And thou, how much dost thou owe? And he said, A hundred cors of wheat. And he says to him, Take thy writing and write eighty. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ñu tơña kơ sa čô pơkŏn: ‘Bơ ih, hơdôm ih đom hơnưh?’ Gơ̆ laĭ glaĭ: ‘Sa rơtuh reo pơdai.’ Ñu laĭ kơ gơ̆: ‘Mă hră hơnưh ih laih anŭn čih glaĭ sapăn pluh.’ 
And the lord praised the unrighteous steward because he had done prudently. For the sons of this world are, for their own generation, more prudent than the sons of light. @ Khua kơ pô wai lăng sang ƀu tŏng ten anŭn bơni kơ ñu, yua kơ ñu ngă laih hăng tơlơi kơhnâo; yua kơ ƀing mơnuih rơnŭk anai kơhnâo hloh kơ ƀing ană bă tơlơi bơngač amăng tơlơi gơñu hơdip hăng tơdruă.

And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things, and mocked him. @ Ƀing Pharisi, jing ƀing hưp ham kơ prăk, hmư̆ abih tơlơi anŭn laih anŭn gơñu djik kơ Yêsu. 
And he said to them, *Ye* are they who justify themselves before men, but God knows your hearts; for what amongst men is highly thought of is an abomination before God. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ gơñu: “Ƀing gih jing ƀing mơnuih ngă mă tơpă hơnơ̆ng ƀơi anăp ană mơnuih, samơ̆ Ơi Adai thâo pran jua ƀing gih; yua kơ hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing ană mơnuih pơpŭ, Ơi Adai bơrơmŭt khĕl kơ tơlơi anŭn.
The law and the prophets [were] until John: from that time the glad tidings of the kingdom of God are announced, and every one forces his way into it. @ Tơlơi juăt laih anŭn boh pơhiăp laĭ lui hlâo hmâo truh pơ rơnŭk Yôhan đôč; čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng rơnŭk anŭn arăng pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai, laih anŭn abih bang mơnuih yua tơlơi kơtang pơrơsua kiăng kơ mŭt ƀơi anŭn. 
But it is easier that the heaven and the earth should pass away than that one tittle of the law should fail. @ Lŏn rai adai rơgao hĭ amuñ hloh kơ sut hĭ sa tŭt sa gat boh hră amăng tơlơi juăt.
Every one who puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery; and every one that marries one put away from a husband commits adultery. @ Hlơi pô klaih lui bơnai ñu laih anŭn dŏ bơnai pơkŏn ñu soh klĕ pyu yơh; laih anŭn hlơi pô dŏ sa čô đah kơmơi rơkơi ñu klaih lui laih ăt jing soh klĕ pyu mơ̆n.”
Now there was a rich man and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, making good cheer in splendour every day. @ “Hmâo sa čô mơnuih pơdrŏng buh ao mriah ngă hăng bơnal kơbuă añĕ ară, rĭm hrơi ƀơ̆ng mơñum mơnơ̆ng hiam jơman. 
And [there was] a poor man, by name Lazarus, [who] was laid at his gateway full of sores, @ Hmâo sa čô mơnuih ƀun rin, anăn gơ̆ Lasar, dŏ đih ƀơi amăng jang ñu, drơi jan gơ̆ bă hăng mruih kơčung.

And it came to pass that the poor man died, and that he was carried away by the angels into the bosom of Abraham. And the rich man also died and was buried. @ Mơnuih ƀun rin anŭn djai hĭ, laih anŭn ƀing ling jang hiam pŭ ba pioh gơ̆ ƀơi tơda Abraham.

And in hades lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he sees Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. @ Amăng plei ƀing djai tơdang ñu dŏ ruă nuă tơnap tap, ñu angak mơta lăng đĭ laih anŭn ƀuh Abraham pơ ataih laih anŭn Lasar dŏ ƀơi tơda ñu. 
And he crying out said, Father Abraham, have compassion on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering in this flame. @ Ñu ur kraih: ‘Ơ ama Abraham, pap drap kơ kâo đa, pơkiaŏ rai bĕ Lasar añrŭ jŭng čơđeng amăng ia laih anŭn ngă rơơ̆ brơi jơlah kâo, yua kơ amăng jơlah apui anai kâo ruă nuă tơnap tap biă mă.’ 
But Abraham said, Child, recollect that *thou* hast fully received thy good things in thy lifetime, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But now he is comforted here, and *thou* art in suffering. @ Samơ̆ Abraham laĭ: ‘Ơ dăm, hơdơr glaĭ bĕ hlăk ih dŏ hơdip ih hmâo mă tŭ laih lu tơlơi hiam mơak, bơ Lasar tŭ mă lu tơlơi sat.

And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm is fixed, so that those who desire to pass hence to you cannot, nor do they who [desire to cross] from there pass over unto us. @ Hloh kơ anŭn dơ̆ng, kơplah wah gơmơi hăng ih hmâo sa amăng luh prŏng dlam, tơl kơ hlơi mơ̆ng anai kiăng nao pơ anŭn ƀu dưi ôh, laih anŭn hlơi mơ̆ng anŭn kiăng rai pơ anai ăt kŏn dưi lơi.’ 
And he said, I beseech thee then, father, that thou wouldest send him to the house of my father, @ Mơnuih pơdrŏng laĭ: ‘Tơdah tui anŭn kâo rơkâo kơwưh kơ ih, ơ ama, pơkiaŏ nao bĕ Lasar nao pơ sang ama kâo,

But Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets: let them hear them. @ Samơ̆ Abraham laĭ: ‘Gơñu hmâo laih Môis hăng ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo. Brơi gơñu dŏ hmư̆ ƀing anŭn bĕ.’ 
But he said, Nay, father Abraham, but if one from the dead should go to them, they will repent. @ Pô pơdrŏng laĭ glaĭ ‘Ư ưh, ơ ama Abraham, samơ̆ tơdah hmâo mơnuih djai hơdip glaĭ nao pơ gơñu, sĭt gơñu či kơhmal tơlơi soh gơñu.’ 
And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, not even if one rise from among [the] dead will they be persuaded. @ Abraham laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Tơdah gơñu ƀu gưt hmư̆ ôh Môis hăng ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo, wơ̆t dah hmâo mơnuih djai hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng kŏn hmâo tơlơi hơgĕt dưi ngă brơi kơ ƀing gơñu đaŏ lơi.’”
And he said to his disciples, It cannot be but that offences come, but woe [to him] by whom they come! @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Tơlơi pơteč tơhnač khŏm truh sĭt, samơ̆ răm ƀăm yơh kơ hlơi pô ngă tơlơi teč tơhnač anŭn! 
It would be [more] profitable for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea, than that he should be a snare to one of these little ones. @ Hiam hloh akă ƀơi tơkuai pô anŭn sa boh rơsŭng boh pơtâo laih anŭn glŏm hĭ ñu amăng ia rơsĭ, hloh kơ lui ñu ngă brơi sa čô amăng ƀing anĕt anai ngă soh.

And the apostles said to the Lord, Give more faith to us. @ Ƀing khua ding kơna laĭ hăng Khua Yang: “Rơkâo kơ Ih thim brơi tơlơi đaŏ ƀing gơmơi!”
But the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [seed], ye had said to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you. @ Khua Yang laĭ: “Tơdah ƀing gih hmâo tơlơi đaŏ đơr sa asar pơjeh añăm bơi, ƀing gih dưi laĭ kơ phŭn kơyâo sikamôr anai: ‘Tơbuč bĕ ih laih anŭn nao čăt amăng ia rơsĭ,’ laih anŭn ñu či gưt kơ ƀing gih mơ̆n.”
But which of you [is there] who, having a bondman ploughing or shepherding, when he comes in out of the field, will say, Come and lie down immediately to table? @ “Hmâo mơ̆ hlơi amăng ƀing gih hmâo sa čô ding kơna nao čuar hmua ƀôdah wai triu, tơdah ñu phrâo glaĭ mơ̆ng hmua gih či laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Rai tañ bĕ dŏ ber ƀơ̆ng huă mơtam’?

And it came to pass as he was going up to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. @ Tơdang Yêsu nao pơ Yêrusalem, Ñu găn nao kơplah wah guai tring Samari hăng tring Galilê. 
And as he entered into a certain village ten leprous men met him, who stood afar off. @ Tơ Ñu mŭt amăng sa boh plei anŭn, hmâo pluh čô mơnuih djơ̆ phŭng rai čơkă Ñu. Gơñu dŏ pơ ataih 
And they lifted up [their] voice saying, Jesus, Master, have compassion on us. @ laih anŭn iâu kraih: “Ơ Yêsu, Ơ Nai, pap mơñai kơ gơmơi đa!”
And seeing [them] he said to them, Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass as they were going they were cleansed. @ Tơ Yêsu ƀuh gơñu, Ñu laĭ: “Nao pơrơđah bĕ ƀing gih pô kơ ƀing khua ngă yang.” Laih anŭn tơdang gơñu nao, gơñu hmâo tơlơi rơgoh. 
And one of them, seeing that he was cured, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice, @ Sa čô amăng ƀing gơñu, ƀuh ñu hlao laih, ñu wơ̆t glaĭ pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai hăng săp kraih kơtang.

And he said to him, Rise up and go thy way: thy faith has made thee well. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Tơgŭ nao bĕ, tơlơi đaŏ ih hmâo pơklaih ih laih.”
And having been asked by the Pharisees, When is the kingdom of God coming? he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation; @ Ƀing Pharisi tơña kơ Yêsu hơbin dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai či truh, laih anŭn Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai ƀu rai hăng tơlơi klă rơđah tơl arăng dưi ƀuh ôh.

And he said to the disciples, Days are coming, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see [it]. @ Ñu laĭ dơ̆ng kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Či hmâo sa hrơi ƀing gih čang kiăng dưi ƀuh sa hrơi Ană Mơnuih, samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu dưi ƀuh ôh.

they ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all [of them]; @ Arăng ƀơ̆ng mơñum, pơdŏ rơkơi bơnai, gơñu brơi ană bă pơdŏ rơkơi bơnai, tơl truh hrơi Nôê mŭt amăng kompăn, laih anŭn ia lip truh pơrai hĭ gơñu.

And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Khua Yang laĭ: “Hmư̆ bĕ hơgĕt tơlơi khua phat kơđi ƀu tơpă laĭ. 
And shall not God at all avenge his elect, who cry to him day and night, and he bears long as to them? @ Hyư̆m, Ơi Adai ƀu phat brơi kơđi hăng tơlơi tơpă kơ ƀing mơnuih Ñu hmâo ruah mă laih, jing ƀing mơnuih hrơi mlam ur kơwưh kơ Ñu ôh hă? Ñu či pơhrưĭ amăng tơlơi djru kơ gơñu mơ̆?

And he spoke also to some, who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and made nothing of all the rest [of men], this parable: @ Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi bơhmutu anai dơ̆ng kơ đơđa ƀing mơnuih yap gơñu pô jing mơnuih tơpă laih anŭn mưč mač kơ ƀing mơnuih pơkŏn.

And they brought to him also infants that he might touch them, but the disciples when they saw [it] rebuked them. @ Arăng ăt ba nao ƀing čơđai anĕt nao pơ Yêsu, kiăng kơ Ñu dưi ah tơngan ƀơi ƀing gơñu; tơ ƀing ding kơna ƀuh tơlơi anŭn, gơñu khă ƀing ba nao ƀing čơđai.

And he said, All these things have I kept from my youth. @ Pô anŭn laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo gưt laih abih tơlơi anŭn dơ̆ng mơ̆ng kâo dŏ čơđai.”
And when Jesus had heard this, he said to him, One thing is lacking to thee yet: Sell all that thou hast and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in the heavens, and come, follow me. @ Tơ Yêsu hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, Ñu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Ih ăt dŏ kơƀah sa tơlơi.

But he said, The things that are impossible with men are possible with God. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Hơgĕt tơlơi ană mơnuih ƀu dưi ngă ôh, Ơi Adai yơh dưi ngă.”
And Peter said, Behold, *we* have left all things and have followed thee. @ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Lăng anai, gơmơi lui hĭ laih sang gơmơi laih anŭn đuaĭ tui Ih.” 
And he said to them, Verily I say to you, There is no one who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hlơi pô lui laih pưk sang, ană bơnai, adơi ayŏng, amĭ ama, yua kơ dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai,

And he took the twelve to [him] and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written of the Son of man by the prophets shall be accomplished; @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Yêsu ba pluh dua čô khua ding kơna nao hơjăn hăng laĭ kơ gơñu: “Anai nê, ƀing ta đĭ nao pơ Yêrusalem.

And they understood nothing of these things. And this word was hidden from them, and they did not know what was said. @ Samơ̆ ƀing ding kơna ƀu thâo hluh ôh tơlơi anŭn, yua kơ khul boh pơhiăp anŭn jing hơgơ̆m kơ gơñu, laih anŭn gơñu ƀu thâo hluh ôh hơgĕt tơlơi Yêsu kiăng laĭ.
And it came to pass when he came into the neighbourhood of Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the wayside begging. @ Tơ Yêsu giăm truh pơ Yêrikô, hmâo sa čô mơnuih bum mơta dŏ ber rơkâo dan ƀơi akiăng jơlan. 
And when he heard the crowd passing, he inquired what this might be. @ Gơ̆ hmư̆ phung lu găn ƀơi anŭn, gơ̆ tơña hơgĕt tơlơi anŭn. 
And they told him that Jesus the Nazaraean was passing by. @ Arăng laĭ glaĭ: “Yêsu plei Nasaret hlăk găn nao.” 
And he called out saying, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me. @ Pô bum anŭn ur kraih mơtam: “Ơ Yêsu, Ană Pơtao Đawit, rơkâo Ih pap mơñai kơ kâo đa!” 
And those [who were] going before rebuked him that he might be silent; but *he* cried out so much the more, Son of David, have mercy on me. @ Ƀing mơnuih nao hlâo khă brơi ñu dŏ rơiăt. Samơ̆ gơ̆ ur kơtang hloh dơ̆ng: “Ơ Ană Pơtao Đawit, rơkâo Ih pap mơñai kơ kâo đa!” 
And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be led to him. And when he drew nigh he asked him [saying], @ Yêsu dŏ hĭ, brơi arăng ba gơ̆ nao pơ Ñu; laih anŭn tơ ñu nao giăm, Yêsu tơña kơ gơ̆, 
What wilt thou that I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I may see. @ “Hơgĕt ih kiăng Kâo ngă brơi kơ ih?” Gơ̆ laĭ: “Ơ khua Yang, brơi kâo thâo ƀuh glaĭ dơ̆ng.”
And Jesus said to him, See: thy faith has healed thee. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ƀuh rơđah bĕ! Tơlơi đaŏ ih hmâo pơsuaih ih laih.”
And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people when they saw [it] gave praise to God. @ Tañ mơtam gơ̆ ƀuh glaĭ rơđah dơ̆ng laih anŭn đuaĭ tui Yêsu, pơpŭ bơni kơ Ơi Adai. Abih bang ƀing ană plei ƀuh tơlơi anŭn, gơñu bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai.
And he entered and passed through Jericho. @ Yêsu mŭt amăng Plei Yêrikô laih anŭn găn plei anŭn. 
And behold, [there was] a man by name called Zacchaeus, and he was chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich. @ Pơ anŭn hmâo sa čô mơnuih pơdrŏng anăn ñu Sačê, ñu jing sa čô khua ƀing ring jia. 
And he sought to see Jesus who he was: and he could not for the crowd, because he was little in stature. @ Ñu hơduah kiăng lăng hlơi Yêsu jing, samơ̆ ƀu dưi ƀuh ôh yua kơ ƀing mơnuih lu, laih anŭn ñu jing mơnuih ber. 
And running on before, he got up into a sycamore that he might see him, for he was going to pass that [way]. @ Tui anŭn ñu nao hlâo laih anŭn đĭ ƀơi phŭn kơyâo Sikamôr kiăng lăng Yêsu, yua kơ Yêsu či găn nao pơ anŭn. 
And when he came up to the place, Jesus looked up and saw him, and said to him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for to-day I must remain in thy house. @ Tơ Yêsu truh pơ anih anŭn, Yêsu angak lăng đĭ hăng laĭ: “Ơ Sačê trŭn tañ bĕ, yua kơ hrơi anai Kâo khŏm dŏ glaĭ amăng sang ih.”
And he made haste and came down, and received him with joy. @ Tui anŭn Sačê trŭn ječ meč mơtam hăng hơ̆k kơdơ̆k jum Yêsu. 
And all murmured when they saw [it], saying, He has turned in to lodge with a sinful man. @ Ƀing mơnuih lu ƀuh tui anŭn, leng kơ pơhiăp brŏk hăng laĭ: “Mơnuih anai mŭt dŏ amăng sang mơnuih soh.”
But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I return [him] fourfold. @ Samơ̆ Sačê tơgŭ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp Khua Yang hăng laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, anai nê kâo či mă ha mơkrah dram gơnam kâo laih anŭn pơpha brơi hĭ kơ ƀing mơnuih ƀun rin laih anŭn tơdah kâo hmâo plư ƀơ̆ng gơnam arăng, kâo či kla glaĭ pă wơ̆t lu hloh.”
And Jesus said to him, To-day salvation is come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Hrơi anai tơlơi pơklaih hmâo mŭt laih amăng sang anai, yua kơ pô anai ăt jing sa čô ană tơčo Abraham mơ̆n. 
for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which is lost. @ Yua kơ Ană Mơnuih rai laih kiăng hơduah laih anŭn pơklaih ƀing răm rơngiă.”
But as they were listening to these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was about to be immediately manifested. @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, Yêsu pơhiăp sa tơlơi bơhmutu dơ̆ng, yua kơ Ñu giăm truh pơ plei Yêrusalem, laih anŭn yua kơ arăng pơmĭn dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai či pơrơđah mơtam yơh. 
He said therefore, A certain high-born man went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and return. @ Tui anŭn Yêsu laĭ: “Sa čô mơnuih arăng pơpŭ nao pơ čar ataih kiăng kơ mă tŭ tơlơi dưi jing pơtao giơ̆ng anŭn ñu či wơ̆t glaĭ. 
And having called his own ten bondmen, he gave to them ten minas, and said to them, Trade while I am coming. @ Ñu iâu pluh čô amăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu. Ñu brơi kơ ƀing gơ̆ pluh sar prăk hăng laĭ: ‘Brơi ƀing ih nao sĭ mia hăng sar prăk anai tơl kâo wơ̆t glaĭ dơ̆ng.’ 
But his citizens hated him, and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not that this [man] should reign over us. @ Samơ̆ ƀing ană plei ñu bơrơmŭt kơ gơ̆ laih anŭn pơkiaŏ nao pô pơala kiaŏ tui ñu hăng laĭ: ‘Gơmơi ƀu kiăng ôh mơnuih anai wai lăng gơmơi’.
And it came to pass on his arrival back again, having received the kingdom, that he desired these bondmen to whom he gave the money to be called to him, in order that he might know what every one had gained by trading. @ Giơ̆ng kơ ñu mă tŭ tơlơi dưi jing pơtao ñu wơ̆t glaĭ dơ̆ng, ñu iâu ƀing ding kơna rai pơ ñu, jing ƀing ñu hmâo brơi laih sar prăk, kiăng kơ thâo hyư̆m ƀing gơ̆ ƀơ̆ng kơmlai laih hăng tơlơi sĭ mia anŭn. 
And the first came up, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has produced ten minas. @ Ding kơna tal sa truh ƀơi anăp ñu hăng laĭ: ‘Ơ Khua, sar prăk ih ƀơ̆ng kơmlai dơ̆ng jing pluh sar.’ 
And he said to him, Well [done], thou good bondman; because thou hast been faithful in that which is least, be thou in authority over ten cities. @ Khua laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Hiam yơh, ơ ding kơna tơpă hiam; yua kơ ih hmâo tŏng ten laih amăng bruă anĕt, ih či hmâo tơlơi dưi wai lăng pluh boh plei.’ 
And the second came, saying, [My] Lord, thy mina has made five minas. @ Ding kơna tal dua rai hăng laĭ: ‘Ơ Khua, sar prăk ih ƀơ̆ng kơmlai rơma sar dơ̆ng.’ 
And he said also to this one, And *thou*, be over five cities. @ Ñu laĭ kơ gơ̆: ‘Ih či wai lăng rơma boh plei.’ 
And another came, saying, [My] Lord, lo, [there is] thy mina, which I have kept laid up in a towel. @ Ding kơna pơkŏn rai laih anŭn laĭ: ‘Ơ Khua, anai sar prăk ih, kâo hmâo pơdŏp laih ñu amăng khăn, 
For I feared thee because thou art a harsh man: thou takest up what thou hast not laid down, and thou reapest what thou hast not sowed. @ Yua kơ kâo hwĭ kơ ih, yua kơ ih jing mơnuih khăng khĭp. Ih mă mơnơ̆ng ƀu djơ̆ jing gơnam ih ôh, laih anŭn hơpuă mơnơ̆ng ih ƀu hmâo sai ôh.’ 
He says to him, Out of thy mouth will I judge thee, wicked bondman: thou knewest that *I* am a harsh man, taking up what I have not laid down and reaping what I have not sowed. @ Khua anŭn laĭ kơ ñu: ‘Ơ ding kơna sat ƀai!

And why didst thou not give my money to [the] bank; and *I* should have received it, at my coming, with interest? @ Tui anŭn yua hơgĕt ih ƀu pioh ôh prăk kâo amăng sang wai prăk, kiăng kơ tơ kâo wơ̆t glaĭ, kâo či mă glaĭ prăk anŭn wơ̆t hăng kơmlai ñu mơ̆n?’ 
And he said to those that stood by, Take from him the mina and give [it] to him who has the ten minas. @ Laih anŭn ñu laĭ kơ ƀing dŏ giăm: ‘Mă hĭ bĕ prăk mơ̆ng ñu, hăng brơi hĭ pô hmâo laih pluh sar prăk.’ 
And they said to him, Lord, he has ten minas. @ Gơñu laĭ kơ gơ̆: ‘Ơ khua, ñu hmâo laih pluh sar prăk!’ 
For I say unto you, that to every one that has shall be given; but from him that has not, that even which he has shall be taken from him. @ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hlơi pô hmâo, Ơi Adai či brơi thim dơ̆ng, samơ̆ hlơi pô ƀu hmâo, Ơi Adai či mă hĭ wơ̆t hăng mơnơ̆ng ñu hmâo laih. 
Moreover those mine enemies, who would not [have] me to reign over them, bring them here and slay [them] before me. @ Samơ̆ bơ kơ ƀing ayăt kâo, ƀing ƀu kiăng ôh kâo wai lăng gơñu, ba rai bĕ gơñu pơ anai laih anŭn pơdjai hĭ gơñu ƀơi anăp kâo.”
And having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem. @ Giơ̆ng kơ Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, Ñu rơbat nao hlâo, đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
And it came to pass as he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany at the mountain called [the mount] of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, @ Tơ Ñu giăm truh pơ plei Bêtphajê hăng plei Bêthani, ƀơi čư̆ arăng pơanăn jing čư̆ Ôliwơ, Ñu pơkiaŏ nao dua čô ƀing ding kơna Ñu 
saying, Go into the village over against [you], in which ye will find, on entering it, a colt tied up, on which no [child] of man ever sat at any time: loose it and lead it [here]. @ hăng laĭ: “Nao bĕ pơ plei ƀơi anăp ƀing gih.

And if any one ask you, Why do ye loose [it]? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord has need of it. @ Tơdah arăng tơña kơ ƀing gih: ‘Yua hơgĕt ƀing gih kleh ñu lĕ?’ brơi ƀing gih laĭ tui anai: ‘Khua Yang kiăng ñu.’”
And they that were sent, having gone their way, found as he had said to them. @ Tui anŭn ƀing gơñu nao hăng ƀuh abih bang tơlơi djơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi Yêsu hmâo laĭ laih. 
And as they were loosing the colt, its masters said to them, Why loose ye the colt? @ Tơdang gơñu kleh ană aseh kle anŭn, pô aseh anŭn tơña kơ gơñu: “Yua hơgĕt ƀing gih kleh ană aseh kle anai lĕ?”
And they said, Because the Lord has need of it. @ Gơñu laĭ: “Khua Yang kiăng ñu.” 
And they led it to Jesus; and having cast their own garments on the colt, they put Jesus on [it]. @ Laih anŭn gơñu dui ba aseh pơ Yêsu; gơñu tap khăn ao gơñu ƀơi rŏng ană aseh kle laih anŭn pŭ Yêsu đĭ. 
And as he went, they strewed their clothes in the way. @ Tơ Yêsu đĭ aseh kle rơbat nao, gơñu lang khăn ao gơñu ƀơi jơlan.
And as he drew near, already at the descent of the mount of Olives, all the multitude of the disciples began, rejoicing, to praise God with a loud voice for all the works of power which they had seen, @ Hlăk Yêsu giăm truh pơ plei Yêrusalem ƀơi anih trŭn đŭng čư̆ Ôliwơ, abih bang ƀing ding kơna čơdơ̆ng hơ̆k mơak laih anŭn pơpŭ bơni kơ Ơi Adai hăng asăp kraih yua kơ abih bang khul bruă mơsêh mơyang gơñu hmâo ƀuh laih.

And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, Teacher, rebuke thy disciples. @ Amăng tơ̆ng krah ƀing mơnuih lu hmâo đơđa ƀing Pharisi laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, khă bĕ ƀing ding kơna Ih.” 
And he answering said to them, I say unto you, If these shall be silent, the stones will cry out. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, tơdah gơñu dŏ rơiăt, boh pơtâo yơh či ur driao.”
And as he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, @ Tơ Yêsu nao giăm, Ñu ƀuh plei Yêrusalem, Ñu hia yua kơ plei anŭn hăng laĭ, 
saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, even at least in this thy day, the things that are for thy peace: but now they are hid from thine eyes; @ “Kâo kiăng biă mă yơh tơdah hrơi anai ih dưi thâo tơlơi dưi brơi tơlơi rơnŭk rơnua kơ ih! Samơ̆ ră anai tơlơi anŭn pơdŏp hĭ laih kơ mơta ih.

And entering into the temple, he began to cast out those that sold and bought in it, @ Yêsu mŭt amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ laih anŭn čơdơ̆ng pơpuh ƀing sĭ mia ƀơi anŭn,

And he was teaching day by day in the temple: and the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, @ Rĭm hrơi Yêsu pơtô amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ.

And they answered, they did not know whence. @ Tui anŭn gơñu laĭ glaĭ gơñu ƀu thâo ôh mơ̆ng pă tơlơi ƀatem anŭn tơbiă rai.

And he began to speak to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen, and left the country for a long time. @ Yêsu čơdơ̆ng pơhiăp tơlơi bơhmutu anai kơ ƀing ană plei pla: “Sa čô mơnuih ngă sa boh đang boh kơƀâu laih anŭn brơi kơ arăng čan, laih anŭn ñu nao pơ tring pơkŏn sui hrơi. 
And in the season he sent to the husbandmen a bondman, that they might give to him of the fruit of the vineyard; but the husbandmen, having beaten him, sent [him] away empty. @ Tơ truh bơyan pĕ boh, pô đang pơkiaŏ nao sa čô ding kơna ñu pơ ƀing čan anŭn kiăng kơ ƀing čan brơi kơ ñu sa črăn boh kơmlai mơ̆ng đang boh kơƀâu anŭn.

And again he sent another bondman; but they, having beaten him also, and cast insult upon him, sent [him] away empty. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn pô đang pơkiaŏ nao dơ̆ng sa čô ding kơna pơkŏn. Samơ̆ ƀing mơnuih apah ăt taih gơ̆, laih anŭn ngă sat kơ gơ̆, hăng brơi gơ̆ glaĭ hăng tơngan soh. 
And again he sent a third; and they, having wounded him also, cast [him] out. @ Pô đang pơkiaŏ nao ding kơna tal klâo dơ̆ng, samơ̆ gơñu ăt taih pơrơka gơ̆ hăng puh pơđuaĭ hĭ gơ̆. 
And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: perhaps when they see him they will respect [him]. @ Hlăk anŭn pô đang boh kơƀâu laĭ: ‘Hơgĕt kâo či ngă? Kâo či pơkiaŏ nao ană đah rơkơi pô kâo khăp hơeng; Năng ai gơñu či pơpŭ kơ gơ̆.’ 
But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; [come,] let us kill him, that the inheritance may become ours. @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing čan ƀuh gơ̆, gơñu bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu: ‘Anai jing pô mă tŭ kong ngăn; brơi ƀing ta pơdjai hĭ ñu, kiăng kơ kong ngăn anŭn či lơ̆m kơ ƀing ta.’ 
And having cast him forth out of the vineyard, they killed [him]. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them? @ Gơñu glŏm hĭ gơ̆ pơ gah rơngiao đang boh kơƀâu hăng pơdjai hĭ gơ̆. Tui anŭn hơgĕt pô đang boh kơƀâu či ngă kơ ƀing gơñu? 
He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it they said, May it never be! @ Pô anŭn či rai pơdjai hĭ ƀing čan anŭn, laih anŭn jao đang boh kơƀâu kơ ƀing pơkŏn.” Tơdah ƀing ană plei hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơñu laĭ: “Ư ưh, brơi Ơi Adai khă tơlơi anŭn!”
But he looking at them said, What then is this that is written, The stone which they that builded rejected, this has become the corner-stone? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu lăng kơ gơñu laih anŭn laĭ: “Tui anŭn, hơgĕt tơlơi Ơi Adai Pơhiăp čih anai kiăng laĭ:

And the chief priests and the scribes sought the same hour to lay hands on him, and they feared the people; for they knew that he had spoken this parable of them. @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hơduah jơlan kiăng mă Yêsu ƀơi mông anŭn mơtam, yua kơ gơñu thâo Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi bơhmutu anŭn djơ̆ kơ gơñu; samơ̆ gơñu hwĭ kơ ƀing ană plei pla. 
And having watched [him], they sent out suborned persons, pretending to be just men, that they might take hold of him in [his] language, so that they might deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor. @ Tui anŭn gơñu krăp lăng sŭ Yêsu, laih anŭn pơkiaŏ nao ƀing kơnuă pơƀlor mă jing kar hăng ƀing mơnuih tơpă hiam, kiăng hmâo tơlơi dưi pơčŭt kơ tơlơi Yêsu pơhiăp, kiăng kơ gơñu dưi jao gơ̆ kơ kơnuk kơna laih anŭn kơ khua prŏng Rôm. 
And they asked him saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest no [man's] person, but teachest with truth the way of God: @ Ƀing anŭn tơña kơ Yêsu: “Ơ nai, gơmơi thâo ih pơhiăp laih anŭn pơtô hăng tơlơi tơpă.

Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not? @ Phiăn mơ̆ ƀing ta duh jia kơ Sêsar?”
But perceiving their deceit he said to them, Why do ye tempt me? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu thâo tơlơi mơneč gơñu laih anŭn laĭ kơ gơñu, 
Shew me a denarius. Whose image and superscription has it? And answering they said, Caesar's. @ “Brơi Kâo lăng sa kak đơniê. Kak đơniê anai hmâo rup hăng anăn hlơi?” Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Sêsar.”
And he said to them, Pay therefore what is Caesar's to Caesar, and what is God's to God. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Tui anŭn ba glaĭ bĕ kơ Sêsar gơnam kơ Sêsar, laih anŭn ba glaĭ bĕ gơnam Ơi Adai kơ Ơi Adai.”
And they were not able to take hold of him in [his] expressions before the people, and, wondering at his answer, they were silent. @ Ƀơi anăp ană plei pla, gơñu ƀu hmâo tơlơi dưi pơčŭt kơ Yêsu kơ sa mơta tơlơi hơgĕt ôh. Gơñu hling hlang kơ tơlơi Yêsu laĭ glaĭ, laih anŭn gơñu dŏ rơiăt.
And some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, coming up [to him], @ Hmâo đơđa ƀing Sadusi rai pơ Yêsu, jing ƀing laĭ ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng ôh. 
demanded of him saying, Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother, who has a wife, die, and he die childless, his brother shall take the wife and raise up seed to his brother. @ Gơñu tơña Yêsu tui anai: “Ơ Nai, Môis čih laih tơlơi juăt kơ ƀing gơmơi tơdah sa čô ayŏng djai, hmâo bơnai samơ̆ ƀu hmâo ană ôh, brơi adơi gơ̆ mă dŏ bơnai ayŏng ñu, kiăng hmâo ană djă pioh djuai ayŏng ñu. 
There were then seven brethren: and the first, having taken a wife, died childless; @ Anai nê, hmâo laih tơjuh čô adơi ayŏng. Ayŏng tha dŏ bơnai laih anŭn djai, ƀu hmâo ană ôh. 
and the second [took the woman, and *he* died childless]; @ Adơi tal dua dŏ đah kơmơi anŭn mơ̆n, 
and the third took her: and in like manner also the seven left no children and died; @ tal klâo dŏ đah kơmơi anŭn mơ̆n, tơl abih bang tơjuh čô adơi ayŏng dŏ đah kơmơi anŭn, djai ƀu hmâo ană ôh. 
and last of all the woman also died. @ Đŭt tơdơi, đah kơmơi anŭn ăt djai mơ̆n. 
In the resurrection therefore of which of them does she become wife, for the seven had her as wife? @ Tui anŭn, ƀơi hrơi hơdip glaĭ, đah kơmơi anŭn či jing bơnai kơ hlơi lĕ? yua kơ abih tơjuh čô anŭn leng kơ hmâo dŏ laih ñu.”
And Jesus said to them, The sons of this world marry and are given in marriage, @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing ană rơnŭk anai dŏ rơkơi dŏ bơnai, 
but they who are counted worthy to have part in that world, and the resurrection from among [the] dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage; @ samơ̆ ƀing arăng yap năng lăp mŭt amăng rơnŭk tơdơi laih anŭn kơ tơlơi hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng ƀing djai ƀu či dŏ rơkơi dŏ bơnai dơ̆ng ôh,

But that the dead rise, even Moses shewed in [the section of] the bush, when he called [the] Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob; @ Bơ kơ tơlơi ƀing djai hơdip glaĭ, wơ̆t kơ Môis bơrơđah laih amăng tơlơi čih ră ruai kơ apui ƀơ̆ng pum drơi dŏ jă, hlăk ñu iâu Khua Yang jing Ơi Adai kơ Abraham, Ơi Adai kơ Isak, laih anŭn Ơi Adai kơ Yakôp.

And some of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well spoken. @ Hmâo đơđa ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt laĭ glaĭ dơ̆ng: “Ơ Nai, Ih pơhiăp djơ̆ yơh.” 
For they did not dare any more to ask him anything. @ Tui anŭn gơñu ƀu khĭn tơña kơ Yêsu sa mơta tơlơi hơgĕt dơ̆ng ôh.
And he said to them, How do they say that the Christ is David's son, @ Yêsu tơña kơ gơñu: “Hyư̆m arăng dưi laĭ Yang Krist jing ană pơtao Đawit lĕ? 
and David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand @ Yua kơ Đawit pô laĭ amăng hơdrôm hră Tơlơi Adoh Hơđăp:
‘Khua Yang laĭ hăng Khua Yang kâo: Dŏ ber bĕ gah hơnuă Kâo,

David therefore calls him Lord, and how is he his son? @ Đawit iâu Krist jing ‘Khua Yang’; Tui anŭn hyư̆m Krist dưi jing ană đah rơkơi Đawit lĕ?”
And, as all the people were listening, he said to his disciples, @ Tơdang abih bang ƀing ană plei pla dŏ hmư̆, Ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu, 
Beware of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and who love salutations in the market-places, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places at suppers; @ “Răng bĕ kơ ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt.

And he looked up and saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury; @ Yêsu angak mơta lăng laih anŭn ƀuh ƀing pơdrŏng plĕ prăk gơñu pơyơr amăng hip prăk sang kơkuh pơpŭ. 
but he saw also a certain poor widow casting therein two mites. @ Yêsu ăt ƀuh mơ̆n sa čô đah kơmơi blao ƀun rin pơyơr dua su. 
And he said, Verily I say unto you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all; @ Ñu laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, đah kơmơi blao ƀun rin anai pơyơr lu hloh kơ abih bang ƀing pơkŏn. 
for all these out of their abundance have cast into the gifts [of God]; but she out of her need has cast in all the living which she had. @ Yua kơ abih bang ƀing anŭn mă prăk rơbeh gơñu pơyơr kơ Ơi Adai, bơ kơ đah kơmơi anai ƀun rin biă mă samơ̆ ñu mă abih dram gơnam ñu hmâo kiăng dŏ hơdip pơyơr hĭ kơ Ơi Adai.”
And as some spoke of the temple, that it was adorned with goodly stones and consecrated offerings, he said, @ Tơdang hmâo đơđa mơnuih laĭ djơ̆ kơ sang kơkuh pơpŭ, tơlơi arăng pơhrôp pơhiam ñu hăng boh pơtâo yom, laih anŭn gơnam arăng pơyơr, Yêsu laĭ, 
[As to] these things which ye are beholding, days are coming in which there shall not be left stone upon stone which shall not be thrown down. @ “Kơ gơnam ƀing gih ƀuh anai, hrơi či truh, hlăk anŭn ƀu či hmâo sa boh pơtâo dŏ ƀơi hăng ngŏ boh pơtâo pơkŏn ôh, samơ̆ abih bang či glưh hĭ.”
And they asked him saying, Teacher, when then shall these things be; and what [is] the sign when these things are going to take place? @ Gơñu tơña kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, hơbin tơlơi anŭn či truh, laih anŭn hơgĕt gru kơnăl kơ tơlơi anŭn giăm truh?”
And he said, See that ye be not led astray, for many shall come in my name, saying, *I* am [he], and the time is drawn nigh: go ye not [therefore] after them. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Răng bĕ, anăm brơi arăng plư kơ ƀing gih ôh, yua kơ lu mơnuih či rai ƀlor amăng anăn Kâo laih anŭn laĭ: ‘Kâo yơh Krist’ laih anŭn ‘Hrơi anŭn giăm truh yơh!’ Anăm đuaĭ tui gơñu ôh.

Then he said to them, Nation shall rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing anŭn dơ̆ng: “Djuai mơnuih anai či pơkơdơ̆ng hăng djuai mơnuih pơkŏn, laih anŭn dêh čar pơtao anai či pơblah hăng dêh čar pơtao pơkŏn.

But before all these things they shall lay their hands upon you and persecute you, delivering [you] up to synagogues and prisons, bringing [you] before kings and governors on account of my name; @ Samơ̆ hlâo kơ abih bang tơlơi anŭn truh, arăng či mă ƀing gih, ngă sat kơ ƀing gih, jao ƀing gih kơ khua sang bơjơnum, krư̆ ƀing gih, laih anŭn arăng či dui ba ƀing gih ƀơi anăp ƀing pơtao laih anŭn ƀing khua wai lăng lŏn čar yua kơ anăn Kâo.

But when ye see Jerusalem encompassed with armies, then know that its desolation is drawn nigh. @ “Tơ ƀing gih ƀuh ƀing tơhan wang jum dar plei Yêrusalem laih, tui anŭn brơi ƀing gih thâo tơlơi pơrai plei anŭn giăm truh yơh.

And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth distress of nations in perplexity [at] the roar of the sea and rolling waves, @ “Či hmâo gru kơnăl hling hlang amăng yang hrơi, amăng blan, laih anŭn amăng khul pơtŭ, laih anŭn ƀơi lŏn tơnah či hmâo tơlơi rŭng răng amăng ƀing djuai mơnuih, yua kơ gơñu ƀu thâo hơgĕt ngă ôh tơ hmư̆ dơnai ia rơsĭ laih anŭn ia pah pŭng ur grao.

And he said to them, Behold, as ye enter into the city a man will meet you, carrying an earthen pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goes in; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Anai nê, tơ ƀing gih mŭt amăng plei laih, hmâo sa čô mơnuih đua čeh ia či bưp ƀing gih; đuaĭ tui ñu bĕ mŭt amăng sang ñu mŭt,

In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you. @ Tơ ƀơ̆ng giơ̆ng laih, Ñu ăt ngă kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n laih anŭn laĭ: “Kơčok anai jing kơnol pơgop phrâo amăng drah Kâo, tuh brơi laih yua kơ ƀing gih.”
Moreover, behold, the hand of him that delivers me up [is] with me on the table; @ “Samơ̆ anai, tơngan pô pơblư̆ lui Kâo hlăk dŏ ƀơi kơƀang hrŏm hăng Kâo. 
and the Son of man indeed goes as it is determined, but woe unto that man by whom he is delivered up. @ Yua kơ Ană Mơnuih či nao tui hăng tơlơi Ơi Adai hmâo dưm laih kơ Ñu; samơ̆ răm ƀăm yơh kơ pô pơblư̆ lui Ñu.”
And *they* began to question together among themselves who then it could be of them who was about to do this. @ Ƀing ding kơna čơdơ̆ng tơña tơdruă gơñu kiăng thâo hlơi amăng ƀing gơñu či ngă tơlơi anŭn.

And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them, and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing pơtao djuai tuai yua tơlơi dưi kiăng wai lăng ƀing gơñu; laih anŭn ƀing khua gĭt gai, arăng iâu gơñu jing ƀing mơnuih ngă bruă hiam.

And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, to sift [you] as wheat; @ “Ơ Simôn, Simôn ih lăng anai, Satan kiăng pơi ƀing gih kar hăng pơdai. 
but *I* have besought for thee that thy faith fail not; and *thou*, when once thou hast been restored, confirm thy brethren. @ Samơ̆ Kâo iâu laĭ laih kơ ih, kiăng kơ tơlơi đaŏ ih ƀu tơdu ôh. Laih anŭn tơ ih wơ̆t glaĭ pơ Kâo dơ̆ng, brơi ih pơkơjăp ƀing adơi ayŏng ih bĕ.”
And he said to him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death. @ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, kâo pre rơmet laih kiăng nao hrŏm hăng Ih wơ̆t amăng sang mơnă ƀôdah amăng tơlơi djai.”
And he said, I tell thee, Peter, [the] cock shall not crow to-day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Pêtrôs, Kâo laĭ kơ ih, hrơi anai tơdang mơnŭ aka tơdjô̆ ôh, ih či hơngah ƀu thâo krăn Kâo klâo wơ̆t.”
And he said to them, When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing. @ Yêsu laĭ dơ̆ng: “Tơ Kâo pơkiaŏ ƀing gih nao, ƀu hmâo kơdŭng prăk ƀôdah kơƀao, ƀôdah klĭ juă, ƀing gih hmâo kơƀah hơgĕt mơ̆?” Gơñu laĭ: “Ƀu kơƀah hơgĕt ôh.”
He said therefore to them, But now he that has a purse let him take [it], in like manner also a scrip, and he that has none let him sell his garment and buy a sword; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing gơ̆: “Samơ̆ ră anai, hlơi hmâo kơdŭng prăk djă ba bĕ, hlơi hmâo kơƀao, ăt kar kaĭ mơ̆n; laih anŭn hlơi ƀu hmâo đao ôh, brơi ñu sĭ ao phyung ñu laih anŭn blơi sa ƀĕ đao.

And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough. @ Gơñu laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, hmâo dua ƀĕ đao pơ anai.” Yêsu laĭ: “Djŏp yơh.”
And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Yêsu tơbiă laih anŭn rơbat nao pơ čư̆ Ôliwơ tui hăng tơlơi Ñu juăt ngă; Ƀing ding kơna Ñu nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu. 
And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. @ Tơ Yêsu truh laih pơ anih anŭn, Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Iâu laĭ bĕ kiăng kơ ƀing gih ƀu lĕ ôh amăng tơlơi plư.”
And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and having knelt down he prayed, @ Yêsu nao ataih mơ̆ng ƀing gơñu kơplah wah sa wang arăng glŏm boh pơtâo, Ñu tŏ tơŭt iâu laĭ tui anai, 
saying, Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me: but then, not my will, but thine be done. @ “Ơ Ama, tơdah Ih kiăng, rơkâo Ih mă pơđuaĭ hĭ bĕ kơčok tơlơi ruă nuă anai mơ̆ng Kâo; samơ̆ tui hăng Ih kiăng, ƀu djơ̆ tui hăng Kâo kiăng ôh.” 
And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him. @ Hmâo sa čô ling jang mơ̆ng adai pơrơđah rai kơ Ñu laih anŭn pơkơtang brơi Ñu. 
And being in conflict he prayed more intently. And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth. @ Amăng tơlơi ruă nuă, Ñu iâu laĭ jai kơtang hloh dơ̆ng, ia hô̆ Ñu jing hĭ kar hăng tơdjoh drah prŏng lĕ ƀơi lŏn. 
And rising up from his prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from grief. @ Giơ̆ng kơ iâu laĭ, Yêsu tơgŭ nao pơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu. Ñu ƀuh ƀing gơñu hlăk dŏ pĭt yua kơ tơlơi rơngot.

As he was yet speaking, behold, a crowd, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went on before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him. @ Tơdang Yêsu dŏ pơhiăp, hmâo sa phung mơnuih lu rai; pô arăng pơanăn Yudas, sa čô amăng pluh dua čô ƀing khua ding kơna, ba jơlan ƀing anŭn.

And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ Yudas, ih yua tơlơi čŭm kiăng pơblư̆ lui Ană Mơnuih hă?”
And they who were around him, seeing what was going to follow, said [to him], Lord, shall we smite with [the] sword? @ Tơ ƀing mơnuih dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu ƀuh tơlơi čơdơ̆ng truh, gơñu laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, gơmơi dưi yua đao kiăng koh mơ̆?” 
And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear. @ Sa čô amăng ƀing gơñu koh hĭ ding kơna khua ngă yang prŏng hloh laih anŭn tơĭ hĭ tơngia gah hơnuă ñu.
And Jesus answering said, Suffer thus far; and having touched his ear, he healed him. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ: “Lui bĕ! Anăm koh dơ̆ng ôh!” Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu ruaih ƀơi tơngia pô ding kơna anŭn hăng pơhlao brơi gơ̆.
And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who were come against him, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks? @ Khua Yang Yêsu laĭ tui anai hăng ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, ƀing tơhan gak wai sang kơkuh pơpŭ, laih anŭn ƀing kŏng tha rai mă Ñu: “Ƀing gih djă đao hăng gai rai mă Kâo kar hăng kiăng mă sa čô mơnuih klĕ dŏp hă?

And having laid hold on him, they led him [away], and they led [him] into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed afar off. @ Gơñu mă čăp Yêsu laih anŭn ba pơđuaĭ, gơñu ba Yêsu nao pơ sang khua ngă yang prŏng hloh. Pêtrôs đuaĭ tui mơ̆ng ataih ataih. 
And they having lit a fire in the midst of the court and sat down together, Peter sat among them. @ Gơñu pơtŏ apui tơ̆ng krah wăl sang laih anŭn dŏ ber hrŏm hơbĭt, Pêtrôs ăt dŏ ber tơ̆ng krah ƀing gơñu mơ̆n. 
And a certain maid, having seen him sitting by the light, and having fixed her eyes upon him, said, And this [man] was with him. @ Tơdang Pêtrôs dŏ ber giăm apui, sa čô ding kơna đah kơmơi dŏ lăng kơ ñu ƀu ƀleh mơta ôh, laih anŭn laĭ: “Pô anai ăt dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu mơ̆n.”
But he denied [him], saying, Woman, I do not know him. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs hơngah laih anŭn laĭ: “Ơ yă anŭn hơi, kâo ƀu thâo krăn Ñu ôh.”
And after a short time another seeing him said, And *thou* art of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not. @ Ƀiă kơ anŭn, hmâo sa čô mơnuih pơkŏn ƀuh Pêtrôs laih anŭn laĭ: “Ih ăt jing sa čô amăng ƀing anŭn mơ̆n!”
Samơ̆ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Ơ čơkơi anŭn, kâo ƀu jing ƀing anŭn ôh.”
And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly maintained it, saying, In truth this [man] also was with him, for also he is a Galilaean. @ Năng ai sa mông tơdơi kơ anŭn, hmâo sa čô pô pơkŏn laĭ khŭt khăt tui anai: “Sĭt biă mă pô anai ăt dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu mơ̆n, yua kơ ñu jing mơnuih Galilê mơ̆n.”
And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, [the] cock crew. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Ơ čơkơi anŭn, kâo ƀu thâo ôh hơgĕt tơlơi ih laĭ!”
Hlăk anŭn mơtam tơdang Pêtrôs ăt dŏ pơhiăp, mơnŭ tơdjô̆ hĭ. 
And the Lord, turning round, looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. @ Khua Yang wir lăng pơ Pêtrôs.

And Peter, going forth without, wept bitterly. @ Pêtrôs tơbiă pơ rơngiao laih anŭn hia rơngot biă mă.
And the men who held him mocked him, beating [him]; @ Ƀing mơnuih gak wai Yêsu djik djak kơ Yêsu laih anŭn taih Ñu. 
and covering him up, asked him saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck thee? @ Gơñu gom mơta Yêsu laih anŭn tơña kơ Gơ̆: “Đao lăng bĕ, hlơi hmâo taih Ih?” 
And they said many other injurious things to him. @ Laih anŭn gơñu pơhiăp lu tơlơi ƀrưh hmiah pơkŏn dơ̆ng kơ Yêsu.
And when it was day, the elderhood of the people, both [the] chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and led him into their council, saying, @ Truh mơguah, ƀing kŏng tha amăng ană plei pla, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, laih anŭn ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt bơjơnum hrŏm hơbĭt; laih anŭn gơñu ba Yêsu nao pơ anăp ƀing khua phat kơđi. 
If *thou* art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not at all believe; @ Gơñu laĭ: “Tơdah Ih jing Yang Krist, pơhaih bĕ kơ gơmơi thâo.”
Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Tơdah Kâo laĭ tơlơi anŭn kơ ƀing gih, ƀing gih ƀu či đaŏ ôh;

And they all said, *Thou* then art the Son of God? And he said to them, *Ye* say that I am. @ Abih bang gơñu laĭ: “Tui anŭn Ih jing Ană Ơi Adai hă?” Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih laĭ laih hlơi Kâo jing.”
And they said, What need have we any more of witness, for we have heard ourselves out of his mouth? @ Tui anŭn gơñu laĭ: “Ƀing ta ƀu kiăng hmâo thim tơlơi gơ̆ng jơlan pơkŏn dơ̆ng tah? Ƀing ta hmâo hmư̆ laih tơlơi anŭn mơ̆ng amăng bah Ñu pô.”
And the whole multitude of them, rising up, led him to Pilate. @ Abih bang ƀing anŭn tơgŭ laih anŭn ba Yêsu pơ anăp Pilat. 
And they began to accuse him, saying, We have found this [man] perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king. @ Gơñu čơdơ̆ng pơčŭt kơ Yêsu, laĭ: “Gơmơi ƀuh mơnuih anai pơsur kơnŭng djuai ƀing gơmơi pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ laih anŭn khă gơmơi duh jia kơ Sêsar laih anŭn laĭ kơ ñu Pô jing Yang Krist, jing Pơtao.”
And Pilate demanded of him saying, Art *thou* the king of the Jews? And he answering him said, Thou sayest. @ Pilat tơña kơ Yêsu: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ Ih jing pơtao ană Yuđa?”
Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ih yơh hmâo laĭ laih tơlơi anŭn.”
And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no guilt in this man. @ Pilat laĭ kơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laih anŭn kơ ƀing ană plei pla: “Kâo ƀu ƀuh ôh tơlơi soh amăng mơnuih anai.”
But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee even on to here. @ Samơ̆ gơñu tŭt kơ pơtrŭt Pilat hăng tơlơi laĭ tui anai: “Ñu pơsur ƀing ană plei pla krŭ pơkơdơ̆ng, tơdang pơtô tar ƀar tring Yuđa čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng tring Galilê truh pơ anih anai.”
But Pilate, having heard Galilee [named], demanded if the man were a Galilaean; @ Tơ Pilat hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, ñu tơña kiăng thâo pô anai jing mơnuih Galilê sĭt mơ̆? 
and having learned that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, remitted him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days. @ Tơ ñu thâo Yêsu jing ană plei pla tring dŏ gah yŭ kơ pơtao Hêrôt wai lăng, ñu brơi arăng ba gơ̆ pơ pơtao Hêrôt. Hlăk anŭn Hêrôt hmâo ƀô̆ mơta pơ plei Yêrusalem mơ̆n. 
And when Herod saw Jesus he greatly rejoiced, for he had been a long while desirous of seeing him, because of hearing many things concerning him, and he hoped to see some sign done by him; @ Tơ pơtao Hêrôt ƀuh Yêsu ñu mơak biă mă, yua kơ mơ̆ng sui laih ñu kiăng ƀuh Yêsu.

and he questioned him in many words, but *he* answered him nothing. @ Tui anŭn ñu tơña kơ Yêsu lu tơlơi; samơ̆ Yêsu ƀu laĭ glaĭ ôh. 
And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused him violently. @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laih anŭn ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt dŏ giăm pơčŭt kơ Yêsu kơtang biă mă. 
And Herod with his troops having set him at nought and mocked him, having put a splendid robe upon him, sent him back to Pilate. @ Hêrôt hăng ƀing tơhan ñu ƀrưh hmiah hăng djik djak kơ Yêsu; gơñu buh brơi Yêsu sa blah ao phyung hiam rŏ laih anŭn Hêrôt brơi arăng ba Yêsu glaĭ pơ Pilat dơ̆ng. 
And Pilate and Herod became friends with one another the same day, for they had been at enmity before between themselves. @ Hlâo adih Hêrôt hăng Pilat jing ayăt tơdruă, samơ̆ amăng hrơi anŭn gơñu čơdơ̆ng jing hĭ gơyut gơyâo.
And Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, @ Laih anŭn Pilat iâu pơƀŭt ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng, ƀing khua wai lăng, laih anŭn ƀing ană plei pla,

Having chastised him therefore, I will release him. @ Tui anŭn kâo či taih Ñu hăng gai laih anŭn phư hĭ Ñu.”
But they cried out in a mass saying, Away with this [man] and release Barabbas to us; @ Samơ̆ abih bang gơñu ur hơdrăm bĭt: “Pơdjai hĭ pô anai, laih anŭn phư brơi Barabas kơ gơmơi.”

Pilate therefore, desirous to release Jesus, again addressed [them]. @ Pilat kiăng phư Yêsu, hnŭn yơh ñu pơđur ƀing ană plei pla dơ̆ng. 
But they cried out in reply saying, Crucify, crucify him. @ Samơ̆ gơñu ur: “Pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal! Pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal!”
And he said the third time to them, What evil then has this [man] done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will chastise him therefore and release him. @ Pilat laĭ hăng ƀing gơñu tal klâo: “Hơgĕt tơlơi sat mơnuih anai hmâo ngă laih?

But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he might be crucified. And their voices [and those of the chief priests] prevailed. @ Samơ̆ gơñu jai ur kraih hloh dơ̆ng, brơi arăng khŏm pơ̆ng Yêsu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal; laih anŭn tơlơi gơñu ur kraih dưi hĭ. 
And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place. @ Tui anŭn Pilat phat brơi kơđi tui hăng tơlơi gơñu rơkâo. 
And he released him who, for tumult and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they begged for, and Jesus he delivered up to their will. @ Pilat pŏk brơi pô arăng hmâo krư̆ laih, jing pô gŭ pơkơdơ̆ng laih anŭn tơlơi pơdjai mơnuih, tui hăng ƀing gơñu rơkâo; samơ̆ jao Yêsu kơ ƀing anŭn tui hăng tơlơi gơñu kiăng.
And as they led him away, they laid hold on a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus. @ Tơdang gơñu ba Yêsu, gơñu bưp sa čô mơnuih anăn gơ̆ Simôn mơnuih Siren tơdang gơ̆ glaĭ mơ̆ng hmua, laih anŭn pơgŏ gơ̆ glăm kơyâo bơrơkal tui klon Yêsu.

And when they came to the place which is called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, the other on the left. @ Tơ gơñu truh pơ anih arăng pơanăn anih Klang Akŏ, pơ anŭn gơñu pơ̆ng Yêsu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal, wơ̆t ƀing soh prŏng anŭn, sa čô gah hơnuă, sa čô gah iao. 
And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And, parting out his garments, they cast lots. @ Yêsu iâu laĭ: “Ơ Ama, pap brơi kơ gơñu, yua kơ gơñu ƀu thâo ôh hơgĕt tơlơi gơñu ngă.”

And the people stood beholding, and the rulers also [with them] sneered, saying, He has saved others; let him save himself if this is the Christ, the chosen one of God. @ Ƀing ană plei pla dŏ pơ anŭn dŏ krăp lăng; samơ̆ ƀing khua wai lăng djik djak Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Ñu hmâo pơklaih laih ƀing pơkŏn.

And the soldiers also made game of him, coming up offering him vinegar, @ Wơ̆t ƀing tơhan ăt ƀrưh mưč mơ̆n, nao giăm yơr đĭ ia tơpai mơsăm kơ Yêsu, 
and saying, If *thou* be the king of the Jews, save thyself. @ hăng laĭ: “Tơdah Ih jing Pơtao ană Yuđa, pơklaih bĕ Ih pô!”
And there was also an inscription [written] over him in Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew letters: This is the King of the Jews. @ Gah ngŏ akŏ Yêsu arăng hmâo čih tui anai: “mơnuih anai jing pơtao ană yuđa.”
Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us. @ Sa čô amăng ƀing soh prŏng arăng yol ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal ăt hơtoh djraĭ Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă Ih jing Yang Krist? Pơklaih bĕ pô Ih laih anŭn wơ̆t gơmơi mơ̆n!”
But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost *thou* too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment? @ Samơ̆ pô soh pơkŏn ƀuah gơ̆ hăng laĭ: “Ih ƀu hwĭ kơ Ơi Adai ôh hă? Yua kơ ih ăt tŭ tơlơi phak kar kaĭ mơ̆n.

And he said to Jesus, Remember me, [Lord,] when thou comest in thy kingdom. @ Laih anŭn gơ̆ laĭ: “Ơ Yêsu, rơkâo kơ Ih hơdơr kơ kâo tơ Ih rai amăng dêh čar pơtao Ih.”
And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ih, hrơi anai ih či dŏ hrŏm hăng Kâo amăng Parađi.”
And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour. @ Hlăk anŭn kơplah yang hrơi dơ̆ng, abih bang tring hmâo tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt tơl truh klâo mông klam. 
And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple rent in the midst. @ Tơdang yang hrơi jing kơnăm mơmŏt, khăn păng amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ tơhek hĭ tơ̆ng krah jing dua. 
And Jesus, having cried with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he expired. @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu ur kraih kơtang, laĭ: “Ơ Ama, Kâo jao bơngăt Kâo amăng tơngan Ih!” Laih pơhiăp giơ̆ng Ñu tơĭ pran.
Now the centurion, seeing what took place, glorified God, saying, In very deed this man was just. @ Tơ khua tơhan ƀuh tơlơi hmâo truh laih, ñu pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai hăng laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă pô anai jing mơnuih tơpă!”
And all the crowds who had come together to that sight, having seen the things that took place, returned, beating [their] breasts. @ Abih bang ƀing mơnuih lu pơtŭm glaĭ kiăng lăng tơlơi truh anai; tơ gơñu ƀuh khul tơlơi hmâo truh laih, gơñu đuaĭ glaĭ hăng tŭk tơda.

he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus; @ Ñu nao pơ Pilat hăng rơkâo drơi jan Yêsu.

And it was preparation day, and [the] sabbath twilight was coming on. @ Hrơi anŭn jing hrơi Prăp Rơmet laih anŭn hrơi saƀat jĕ truh.
And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed. @ Ƀing đah kơmơi hmâo đuaĭ tui laih Yêsu mơ̆ng tring Galilê, ăt nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yôsep kiăng lăng pơsat laih anŭn hyư̆m tơlơi arăng pioh drơi jan Yêsu. 
And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the commandment. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu glaĭ prăp rơmet mơnơ̆ng ƀâu mơngưi laih anŭn ia klôñ. Hrơi saƀat gơñu pơdơi tui hăng tơlơi juăt pơkă.
But on the morrow of the sabbath, very early indeed in the morning, they came to the tomb, bringing the aromatic spices which they had prepared. @ Hrơi tal sa amăng hrơi kơ̆m, hlăk ưm mơguah gơñu nao pơ pơsat, djă ba mơnơ̆ng ƀâu mơngưi gơñu hmâo prăp rơmet laih.

And they remembered his words; @ Tui anŭn gơñu hơdơr glaĭ kơ tơlơi Yêsu hmâo pơhiăp laih. 
and, returning from the sepulchre, related all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. @ Gơñu glaĭ mơ̆ng pơsat, laĭ pơthâo abih tơlơi anŭn kơ ƀing pluh sa čô laih anŭn kơ abih bang ƀing ding kơna pơkŏn.

But Peter, rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down he sees the linen clothes lying there alone, and went away home, wondering at what had happened. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs tơgŭ laih anŭn nao pơ pơsat.

and they conversed with one another about all these things which had taken place. @ Gơñu ră ruai tơdruă gơñu kơ abih tơlơi hmâo truh laih. 
And it came to pass as they conversed and reasoned, that Jesus himself drawing nigh, went with them; @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ ră ruai tơdruă gơñu laih anŭn pơrơjah nao rai, Yêsu pô nao giăm gơñu laih anŭn rơbat hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu. 
but their eyes were holden so as not to know him. @ Gơñu ƀuh Yêsu samơ̆ ƀu thâo krăn Ñu ôh. 
And he said to them, What discourses are these which pass between you as ye walk, and are downcast? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih pơrơjah tơdruă tơdang ƀing gih rơbat rŏk jơlan?”
Gơñu dŏ hĭ hăng tơlơi rơngot. 
And one [of them], named Cleopas, answering said to him, Thou sojournest alone in Jerusalem, and dost not know what has taken place in it in these days? @ Sa čô amăng ƀing gơñu, anăn ñu Klêôpas, laĭ glaĭ: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ kơnơ̆ng hơjăn ih hă jing tuai amăng plei Yêrusalem ƀu thâo ôh khul tơlơi hmâo truh laih phrâo ƀiă hơdôm hrơi anai?”
And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazaraean, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people; @ Yêsu tơña gơñu: “Hơgĕt tơlơi anŭn?”
Gơñu laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Tơlơi hmâo truh laih kơ Yêsu Nasaret; Ñu jing sa čô pô laĭ lui hlâo mơyang biă mă amăng bruă ngă laih anŭn amăng tơlơi pơhiăp ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai hăng ƀơi anăp abih bang ană plei pla,

But *we* had hoped that *he* was [the one] who is about to redeem Israel. But then, besides all these things, it is now, to-day, the third day since these things took place. @ Samơ̆ gơmơi hmâo čang rơmang laih kơ Ñu yơh jing Pô song mă ƀing Israel; wơ̆t hnŭn, hmâo klâo hrơi rơgao laih mơ̆ng tơlơi anŭn truh. 
And withal, certain women from amongst us astonished us, having been very early at the sepulchre, @ Hloh anŭn dơ̆ng, hmâo đơđa đah kơmơi amăng ƀing gơmơi hmâo ngă brơi ƀing gơmơi hling hlang biă mă: Hlăk ưm mơguah gơñu nao pơ pơsat,

And some of those with us went to the sepulchre, and found it so, as the women also had said, but him they saw not. @ Đơđa amăng ƀing gơmơi nao pơ pơsat, laih anŭn ăt ƀuh djơ̆ kar hăng ƀing đah kơmơi hmâo ruai laih; samơ̆ gơñu ƀu ƀuh Yêsu ôh.”
And *he* said to them, O senseless and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ơ ƀing mơnuih mlŭk laih anŭn pran jua kaih đaŏ abih tơlơi ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo pơhiăp laih! 
Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory? @ Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă Yang Krist khŏm tŭ abih tơlơi ruă nuă kar hăng anŭn hnŭn kah dưi mŭt amăng tơlơi guh kơang Ñu?” 
And having begun from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Ñu pơblang kơ gơñu khul boh pơhiăp hmâo čih laih djơ̆ kơ Ñu amăng abih Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp, čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng Môis truh kơ abih ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo.
And they drew near to the village where they were going, and *he* made as though he would go farther. @ Tơ gơñu giăm truh pơ plei gơñu kiăng nao; Yêsu ngă kar hăng Ñu kiăng nao ataih hloh dơ̆ng. 
And they constrained him, saying, Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is declining. And he entered in to stay with them. @ Samơ̆ gơñu pơđur Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Dŏ glaĭ hăng ƀing gơmơi bĕ, yua kơ adai klam laih, mlam giăm truh yơh.” Tui anŭn Ñu mŭt dŏ glaĭ hăng ƀing gơñu. 
And it came to pass as he was at table with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken it, gave it to them. @ Tơdang Yêsu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu, Ñu mă ƀañ tơpŭng laih anŭn iâu laĭ bơni hơơč, Ñu wơ̆k ƀañ tơpŭng laih anŭn brơi kơ gơñu. 
And their eyes were opened, and they recognised him. And he disappeared from them. @ Hlăk anŭn mơta gơñu pŏk hĭ, laih anŭn gơñu thâo krăn Yêsu. Samơ̆ Yêsu đuaĭ thĕng mơ̆ng mơta gơñu ƀuh.

And rising up the same hour, they returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven, and those with them, gathered together, @ Mông anŭn mơtam gơñu tơgŭ wơ̆t glaĭ pơ plei Yêrusalem; gơñu bưp hăng ƀing pluh sa čô khua ding kơna hăng ƀing ding kơna pơkŏn hlăk bơjơnum hrŏm hơbĭt. Ƀing anŭn laĭ,

And they related what [had happened] on the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of bread. @ Laih anŭn dua čô ding kơna anŭn kar kaĭ mơ̆n ră ruai hơgĕt tơlơi truh laih kơ gơñu rŏk jơlan, laih anŭn hyư̆m gơñu thâo krăn Yêsu tơdang Ñu wơ̆k ƀañ tơpŭng.

But they, being confounded and being frightened, supposed they beheld a spirit. @ Samơ̆ gơñu hñơ̆t kơtuă hăng hwĭ bral, pơmĭn dah ƀuh atâo.

And having said this he shewed them his hands and his feet. @ Giơ̆ng Yêsu pơhiăp tui anŭn, Ñu pơdah tơngan hăng tơkai Ñu brơi kơ gơñu lăng. 
But while they yet did not believe for joy, and were wondering, he said to them, Have ye anything here to eat? @ Tơdang ƀing ding kơna aka đaŏ ôh, yua kơ gơñu hơ̆k mơak hăng dŏ kơtuă hling hlang đơi, tui anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Pơ anai ƀing gih hmâo mơnơ̆ng hơgĕt ƀơ̆ng mơ̆?” 
And they gave him part of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb; @ Gơñu brơi kơ Yêsu sa čơđeh akan ŏm. 
and he took it and ate before them. @ Yêsu mă akan anŭn hăng ƀơ̆ng ƀơi anăp gơñu.
And he said to them, These [are] the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all that is written concerning me in the law of Moses and prophets and psalms must be fulfilled. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Abih tơlơi Kâo hmâo pơhiăp laih kơ ƀing gih tơdang Kâo ăt dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing gih, kiăng kơ abih bang tơlơi arăng hmâo čih laih djơ̆ kơ Kâo amăng tơlơi juăt Môis, amăng hră ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo, laih anŭn amăng hră Adoh Hơđăp khŏm krĕp djơ̆ soh sel.”
Then he opened their understanding to understand the scriptures, @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu pŏk tơlơi pơmĭn gơñu, kiăng gơñu thâo hluh Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp.

but as many as received him, to them gave he [the] right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name; @ Samơ̆ hlơi pô tŭ jum Ñu, kiăng laĭ hlơi pô đaŏ kơ anăn Ñu, Ñu brơi kơ mơnuih anŭn tơlơi dưi jing ană bă Ơi Adai,

And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth; @ Boh Pơhiăp hmâo jing hĭ laih mơnuih, dŏ hơdip tơ̆ng krah ƀing ta, bă hăng tơlơi pap laih anŭn tơlơi sĭt.

And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou? @ Anai jing tơlơi Yôhan ngă gơ̆ng jơlan, tơ ƀing Yuđa pơkiaŏ ƀing khua ngă yang hăng ƀing mơnuih Lêwi mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem nao tơña kơ ñu: “Hlơi ih jing?” 
And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ. @ Yôhan pơhaih mơtam, ƀu hơngah ôh. Ñu laĭ: “Kâo ƀu djơ̆ Yang Krist ôh.” 
And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No. @ Gơñu tơña dơ̆ng: “Tui anŭn hlơi ih jing? Djơ̆ mơ̆ ih jing Êli?” Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ƀu djơ̆ Êli ôh.” Gơñu tơña dơ̆ng: “Ih jing pô laĭ lui hlâo hă?” Yôhan laĭ glaĭ: “Ư ưh.” 
They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself? @ Gơñu laĭ kơ ñu: “Tui anŭn hlơi ih jing lĕ? Kiăng kơ gơmơi dưi laĭ glaĭ kơ ƀing hmâo pơkiaŏ rai gơmơi. Hlơi ih laĭ ih jing?” 
He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said Esaias the prophet. @ Ñu laĭ glaĭ:
“Kâo jing asăp sa čô mơnuih ur kraih amăng tơdrŏn har:

And they were sent from among the Pharisees. @ Ƀing mơnuih arăng hmâo pơkiaŏ rai, jing tơpul ƀing Pharisi, 
And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet? @ gơñu tơña kơ Yôhan: “Tơdah ih ƀu jing Yang Krist ôh, kŏn djơ̆ Êli, ăt kŏn djơ̆ pô laĭ lui hlâo lơi, tui anŭn hyư̆m ih dưi ngă ƀatem lĕ?” 
John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know, @ Yôhan laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ngă ƀatem hăng ia, samơ̆ hmâo sa čô dŏ tơ̆ng krah ƀing gih, Pô anŭn ƀing gih ƀu thâo krăn ôh,

These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising. @ Abih tơlơi anŭn hmâo truh laih amăng plei Bêthani ƀơi hang gah adih ia krong Yurdan, anih Yôhan dŏ ngă ƀatem.
On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. @ Hrơi tơdơi Yôhan ƀuh Yêsu rai pơ ñu, hăng laĭ: “Lăng adih, anŭn jing Ană Triu Ơi Adai, jing Pô mă pơđuaĭ hĭ tơlơi soh lŏn tơnah! 
He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he *was* before me; @ Ñu yơh jing Pô kâo hmâo laĭ laih: ‘Hmâo sa čô mơnuih rai tơdơi kơ kâo, Ñu jing Pô prŏng hloh kơ kâo, yua kơ Ñu hmâo laih hlâo kơ kâo.’ 
and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water. @ Kâo pô ƀu thâo krăn Ñu ôh, samơ̆ kâo rai ngă ƀatem hăng ia, kiăng kơ pơrơđah Ñu kơ ƀing ană Israel.” 
And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yôhan ngă gơ̆ng jơlan dơ̆ng tui anai: “Kâo hmâo ƀuh laih Yang Bơngăt Hiam trŭn mơ̆ng adai kar hăng sa drơi čĭm bơrơgơ̆m găm ƀơi hăng ngŏ Ñu. 
And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, *he* said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the] Holy Spirit. @ Kâo pô ƀu thâo krăn Ñu ôh, samơ̆ Pô pơkiaŏ rai kâo ngă ƀatem hăng ia hmâo laĭ laih kơ kâo tui anai: ‘Pô ih ƀuh Yang Bơngăt Hiam trŭn rai hăng dŏ amăng Ñu, Ñu yơh jing Pô ngă ƀatem hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam.’ 
And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God. @ Kâo hmâo ƀuh laih, hăng ngă gơ̆ng jơlan Ñu anai yơh jing Ană Ơi Adai.”
Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples. @ Hrơi tơdơi Yôhan dŏ ƀơi anŭn dơ̆ng hrŏm hơbĭt hăng dua čô amăng ƀing ding kơna ñu; 
And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God. @ Tơdang ñu ƀuh Yêsu rơbat găn ñu laĭ: “Lăng adih, Ană Triu Ơi Adai!” 
And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus. @ Dua čô ding kơna anŭn hmư̆ tơlơi ñu laĭ, gơñu đuaĭ tui Yêsu mơtam. 
But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye? And *they* said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou? @ Yêsu wir glaĭ, ƀuh gơñu đuaĭ tui, Yêsu tơña: “Hơgĕt ƀing gih sem?”
Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Rabi ‘kiăng laĭ Nai’, pơpă anih Ih dŏ?” 
He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Rai lăng bĕ.” Gơñu nao hăng ƀuh anih Ñu dŏ; laih anŭn gơñu dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu amăng hrơi anŭn. Hlăk anŭn năng ai pă mông klam laih. 
Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard [this] from John and followed him. @ Andrê adơi Simôn Pêtrôs jing sa čô amăng dua čô hmư̆ tơlơi Yôhan pơhiăp anŭn hăng đuaĭ tui Yêsu. 
He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ). @ Hlâo kơ abih bang, ñu sem ayŏng ñu Simôn hăng laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Gơmơi hmâo ƀuh laih Yang Mêsi” (kiăng laĭ Yang Krist). 
And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone). @ Ñu ba Simôn nao pơ Yêsu. Yêsu lăng Simôn hăng laĭ: “Ih jing Simôn ană Yôhan. Arăng či iâu ih Sêphas” (kiăng laĭ Pêtrôs).
On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me. @ Hrơi tơdơi, Yêsu kiăng nao pơ kwar Galilê. Ñu sem Philip hăng laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Đuaĭ tui kâo bĕ.” 
And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter. @ Philip jing sa čô mơnuih Plei Bêtsaida, plei hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Andrê, Pêtrôs. 
Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth. @ Philip sem Natanel hăng laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Gơmơi hmâo ƀuh laih Pô Môis hmâo čih amăng Hră Tơlơi Juăt, laih anŭn ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo čih laih mơ̆n; anŭn jing Yêsu Plei Nasaret, ană Yôsep.” 
And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see. @ Natanel laĭ: “Hmâo tơlơi hơgĕt hiam tơbiă rai mơ̆ng plei Nasaret?” Philip laĭ: “Rai lăng bĕ!” 
Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile. @ Yêsu ƀuh Natanel rai pơ Ñu, laih anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Anai jing sa čô mơnuih Israel sĭt, amăng ñu ƀu hmâo tơlơi wĕ wŏ ôh!” 
Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. @ Natanel tơña kơ Yêsu: “Hyư̆m ih thâo krăn kâo?” Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Hlâo kơ Philip iâu ih, hlăk ih dŏ gah yŭ phŭn hra Kâo ƀuh ih laih.” 
Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel. @ Natanel laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Nai, Ih jing Ană Ơi Adai! Ih jing Pơtao ană Israel!” 
Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ yua kơ kâo laĭ kâo ƀuh ih dŏ gah yŭ phŭn hra hnŭn yơh ih đaŏ? Ih či ƀuh lu tơlơi prŏng hloh kơ tơlơi anŭn dơ̆ng.” 
And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih sĭt biă mă, ƀing gih či ƀuh adai pŏk, laih anŭn ling jang Ơi Adai đĭ trŭn ƀơi Ană Mơnuih.”
And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there. @ Klâo hrơi mơ̆ng anŭn, hmâo tơlơi pơkol rơkơi bơnai pơ Plei Kana amăng kwar Galilê. Amĭ Yêsu pơ anŭn mơ̆n. 
And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage. @ Arăng ăt jak Yêsu hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu nao kơ tơlơi pơkol rơkơi bơnai anŭn mơ̆n. 
And wine being deficient, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine. @ Tơ abih tơpai laih, amĭ Yêsu laĭ hăng Yêsu: “Gơñu ƀu hmâo ia tơpai dơ̆ng tah.” 
Jesus says to her, What have I to do with thee, woman? mine hour has not yet come. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ amĭ, hơgĕt tơlơi anai djơ̆ kơ ih hăng kâo? Mông kâo aka truh ôh.” 
His mother says to the servants, Whatever he may say to you, do. @ Amĭ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing buih bruă: “Hơgĕt tơlơi Ñu pơđar kơ ƀing gih brơi ƀing gih ngă mơtam hŏ!” 
Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews, holding two or three measures each. @ Pơ anŭn hmâo năm boh čeh boh pơtâo, pioh yua kơ tơlơi pơrơgoh tui hăng tơlơi juăt ƀing Yuđa. Rĭm boh čeh dưi pioh giăm kơ sa rơtuh lit ia. 
Jesus says to them, Fill the water-vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Tuh ia pơbă abih čeh anai.” Gơñu tuh ia pơbă truh pơ tơƀuai abih čeh anŭn. 
And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry [it] to the feast-master. And they carried [it]. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Tuah ba ia anai kơ pô wai tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă.” Tui anŭn gơñu tuah ba yơh. 
But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine (and knew not whence it was, but the servants knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the bridegroom, @ Tơ pô wai tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă liah ia hmâo jing laih tơpai anŭn, samơ̆ ñu ƀu thâo ôh mơ̆ng pơpă tơbiă rai tơpai anŭn (samơ̆ ƀing ding kơna tuah ia anŭn thâo yơh), pô wai tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă iâu han tao 
and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and when [men] have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine till now. @ hăng laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Rĭm čô mơnuih pơdơ̆ng brơi arăng mơñum ia tơpai hiam blŭng hlâo; laih anŭn tơ arăng mơñum lu laih, ñu brơi mơñum ia tơpai tơba ƀiă.

This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him. @ Anai yơh jing gru tơlơi mơsêh mơyang tal blŭng hlâo Yêsu ngă pơ plei Kana amăng kwar Galilê, pơrơđah tơlơi ang yang Ñu. Hnŭn yơh ƀing ding kơna Ñu đaŏ kơ Ñu. 
After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Yêsu hăng amĭ Ñu, ƀing adơi Ñu hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu trŭn nao pơ Plei Kapernum; gơñu dŏ pơ anŭn ƀiă hrơi.
And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. @ Phĕt Tơlơi Găn ƀing Yuđa giăm truh, tui anŭn Yêsu đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting; @ Amăng Sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ Ñu ƀuh ƀing sĭ rơmo, triu, čĭm bơrơgơ̆m laih anŭn ƀing pơplih prăk dŏ ber ƀơi kơƀang gơñu. 
and, having made a scourge of cords, he cast [them] all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the change of the money-changers, and overturned the tables, @ Yêsu kuĭ hrĕ ngă gai hnuăt, laih anŭn puh pơđuaĭ ƀing anŭn mơ̆ng Sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ, wơ̆t triu hăng rơmo.

and said to the sellers of doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house a house of merchandise. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing sĭ čĭm kơtrâo: “Mă pơđuaĭ bĕ abih gơnam anŭn mơ̆ng anai; Anăm pơjing sang Ama kâo jing hĭ sang sĭ mơdrô ôh.” 
[And] his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house devours me. @ Ƀing ding kơna Ñu hơdơr Tơlơi Ơi Adai pơhiăp hmâo čih: “Ơ Ơi Adai, tơlơi hur har kơ sang Ih, kar hăng apui čuh amăng lăm kâo.”
The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things? @ Ƀing Yuđa tơña kơ Ñu: “Hơgĕt gru kơnăl mơyang Ih pơrơđah kơ gơmơi ƀuh kiăng pơklă kơ tơlơi dưi Ih dưi ngă bruă anai?”
Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Pơrai hĭ bĕ sang kơkuh pơpŭ anai, laih anŭn Kâo či pơdơ̆ng glaĭ ñu amăng klâo hrơi.”
The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days? @ Tui anŭn ƀing Yuđa laĭ: “Arăng pơdơ̆ng sang kơkuh pơpŭ anai pă pluh năm thŭn, samơ̆ Ih či pơdơ̆ng glaĭ ñu kơnơ̆ng amăng klâo hrơi đôč hă?”
But *he* spoke of the temple of his body. @ Samơ̆ sang kơkuh pơpŭ Ñu laĭ anŭn jing drơi jan Ñu pô. 
When therefore he was raised from among [the] dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken. @ Hnŭn yơh, giơ̆ng Yêsu hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng tơlơi djai, ƀing ding kơna Ñu hơdơr glaĭ Yêsu hmâo laĭ tơlơi anŭn; hnŭn yơh gơñu đaŏ kơ Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hăng tơlơi Yêsu hmâo pơhiăp laih.
And when he was in Jerusalem, at the passover, at the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought. @ Tơdang Yêsu dŏ amăng Plei Yêrusalem hlăk hrơi phĕt Tơlơi Găn, lu mơnuih ƀuh gru kơnăl mơyang Yêsu ngă, gơñu đaŏ kơ Yêsu yơh. 
But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all [men], @ Samơ̆ Yêsu ƀu jao Ñu pô kơ gơñu ôh, yua kơ Ñu thâo krăn laih abih bang mơnuih,

But there was a man from among the Pharisees, his name Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; @ Hmâo sa čô amăng ƀing Pharisi anăn ñu Nikôđem. Ñu jing sa čô amăng ƀing khua gĭt gai ană Yuđa. 
he came to him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God, for none can do these signs that thou doest unless God be with him. @ Hlăk mlam, ñu nao pơ Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Rabi, gơmơi thâo Ih jing sa čô nai tơbiă rai mơ̆ng Ơi Adai; ƀu hmâo ôh hlơi dưi ngă tơlơi mơsêh mơyang Ih hmâo ngă laih tơdah ƀu hmâo Ơi Adai dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu.”
Jesus answered and said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born anew he cannot see the kingdom of God. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo laĭ kơ ih sĭt biă mă, tơdah sa čô mơnuih ƀu tơkeng glaĭ dơ̆ng, ñu ƀu dưi ƀuh Dêh Čar Pơtao Ơi Adai ôh.”
Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born being old? can he enter a second time into the womb of his mother and be born? @ Nikôđem laĭ glaĭ: “Hyư̆m sa čô mơnuih tha laih dưi tơkeng glaĭ dơ̆ng lĕ? Dưi mơ̆ ñu mŭt glaĭ amăng kian amĭ ñu hăng tơkeng tal dua dơ̆ng?”
Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except any one be born of water and of Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo laĭ kơ ih sĭt biă mă, tơdah sa čô mơnuih ƀu kơnang kơ ia laih anŭn hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam kiăng kơ tơkeng glaĭ dơ̆ng, ñu anŭn ƀu dưi mŭt amăng Dêh Čar Pơtao Ơi Adai ôh.

Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be? @ Nikôđem tơña: “Hyư̆m tơlơi anai dưi jing lĕ?” 
Jesus answered and said to him, Thou art the teacher of Israel and knowest not these things! @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ih jing nai pơtô kơ ƀing Israel, samơ̆ ih ƀu thâo hluh tơlơi anai ôh hă?

And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus must the Son of man be lifted up, @ Kar hăng Môis yol đĭ laih ala ngă hăng kong amăng tơdrŏn tač, ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n arăng či yol đĭ Ană Mơnuih.

For God so loved the world, that he gave his only-begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but have life eternal. @ Yua kơ Ơi Adai khăp biă mă kơ lŏn tơnah, tơl Ñu brơi Ană Ñu hmâo kơnơ̆ng sa čô, kiăng kơ hlơi pô đaŏ kơ Ană anŭn ñu ƀu răm rơngiă hĭ ôh samơ̆ ñu hmâo tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar.

And this is the judgment, that light is come into the world, and men have loved darkness rather than light; for their works were evil. @ Tơlơi klă kơđi anŭn jing tui anai: Tơlơi bơngač hmâo truh laih amăng lŏn tơnah, samơ̆ ană mơnuih khăp kơ tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt lu hloh kơ tơlơi bơngač, yua kơ bruă gơñu ngă jing soh sat. 
For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light that his works may not be shewn as they are; @ Yua kơ hlơi pô ngă tơlơi sat ñu bơrơmŭt kơ tơlơi bơngač, laih anŭn ƀu nao ôh pơ tơlơi bơngač, hwĭ kơ rơđah hĭ bruă ñu ngă.

After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he abode with them and baptised. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Yêsu hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu nao pơ tring Yuđa. Ñu dŏ hăng gơñu pơ anŭn laih anŭn ngă ƀatem. 
And John also was baptising in Aenon, near Salim, because there was a great deal of water there; and they came to [him] and were baptised: @ Yôhan ăt ngă ƀatem mơ̆n ƀơi plei Ênon, giăm plei Salim, yua kơ pơ anŭn hmâo lu ia, laih anŭn ƀing ană plei rai kiăng tŭ ƀatem. 
for John was not yet cast into prison. @ Hlăk anŭn arăng aka krư̆ Yôhan amăng sang mơnă ôh.
There was therefore a reasoning of the disciples of John with a Jew about purification. @ Hlăk anŭn, hmâo tơlơi pơrơjah tơ̆ng krah ƀing ding kơna Yôhan hăng sa čô mơnuih Yuđa kơ phĕt tơlơi rao pơrơgoh. 
And they came to John and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, he baptises, and all come to him. @ Gơñu nao pơ Yôhan hăng laĭ: “Ơ Nai, pô hmâo dŏ laih hăng ih ƀơi gah adih hang ia krong Yurdan, kơ pô anŭn yơh ih hmâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan laih, ră anai Ñu dŏ ngă ƀatem, abih bang mơnuih leng kơ nao pơ Ñu soh sel.”
John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it be given him out of heaven. @ Yôhan laĭ glaĭ: “Tơdah Ơi Adai ƀu pha brơi, ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi mă tŭ hơgĕt gĕt ôh.

he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee. @ Yêsu tơbiă mơ̆ng kwar Yuđa wơ̆t glaĭ pơ kwar Galilê. 
And he must needs pass through Samaria. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu khŏm găn nao kwar Samari, 
He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. @ Tui anŭn Ñu truh pơ sa boh plei amăng kwar Samari, anăn Sikar jĕ pơ hmua Yakôp brơi kơ ană ñu Yôsep. 
Now a fountain of Jacob's was there; Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the fountain. It was about the sixth hour. @ Pơ anŭn hmâo ia dơmun Yakôp. Yêsu gleh rơbưi yua kơ rơbat, tui anŭn Ñu dŏ ber ƀơi ia dơmun. Hlăk anŭn năng ai pluh dua mông yang hrơi dơ̆ng.
A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink @ Hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi Samari rai sŏ ia. Yêsu laĭ hăng gơ̆: “Pha kâo mơñum ia ih đa.” 
(for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions). @ (Hlăk anŭn ƀing ding kơna Ñu nao laih pơ plei kiăng blơi mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă.)
The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman? for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans. @ Đah kơmơi Samari laĭ kơ Ñu: “Hyư̆m, Ih jing mơnuih Yuđa pŭng kơ rơkâo mơñum ia mơ̆ng kâo jing đah kơmơi Samari lĕ?” (Yua kơ mơnuih Yuđa ƀu pơgop pơlir hăng mơnuih Samari ôh.)
Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơdah ih thâo mơnơ̆ng Ơi Adai pha brơi, laih anŭn tơdah ih thâo krăn hlơi pô dŏ pơhiăp hơbĭt hăng ih: ‘Pha kâo mơñum ia ih đa,’ tui anŭn ih pô či rơkâo kơ Ñu, laih anŭn Ñu či brơi ia hơdip kơ ih.”
The woman says to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water? @ Đah kơmơi laĭ kơ Ñu: “Ơ Khua, ih ƀu hmâo kơthŭng sŏ ia ôh, hloh kơ anŭn ia dơmun anai dlam dơ̆ng; tui anŭn mơ̆ng pơpă ih hmâo ia hơdip anŭn lĕ?

Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Nao iâu rơkơi ih bĕ, hăng wơ̆t glaĭ pơ anai.” 
The woman answered and said, I have not a husband. Jesus says to her, Thou hast well said, I have not a husband; @ Đah kơmơi laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ƀu hmâo rơkơi ôh.” Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Djơ̆ yơh ih laĭ: ‘kâo ƀu hmâo rơkơi ôh’,

Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship. @ Ƀing ơi adon gơmơi kơkuh pơpŭ ƀơi hăng ngŏ čư̆ anai; samơ̆ ƀing ih laĭ amăng plei Yêrusalem yơh jing anih lăp arăng kơkuh pơpŭ.” 
Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, [the] hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Ơ đah kơmơi, đaŏ bĕ kơ Kâo, mông giăm truh, ƀing gih ƀu kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ama ƀơi hăng ngŏ čư̆ anai, kŏn djơ̆ pơ plei Yêrusalem lơi.

The woman says to him, I know that Messias is coming, who is called Christ; when *he* comes he will tell us all things. @ Đah kơmơi anŭn laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Kâo thâo Yang Mêsi či rai ‘Pô anŭn arăng iâu Yang Krist’; Tơ Ñu rai, Ñu či bơrơđah brơi kơ ƀing ta abih bang tơlơi.” 
Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am [he]. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Kâo, pô dŏ pơhiăp hăng ih, jing Pô anŭn yơh.”
And upon this came his disciples, and wondered that he spoke with a woman; yet no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing ding kơna Ñu truh.

The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the city, and says to the men, @ Tui anŭn đah kơmơi anŭn lui hĭ čeh ia ñu, hăng nao pơ plei laĭ kơ ƀing ană plei pla.

They went out of the city and came to him. @ Gơñu tơbiă mơ̆ng plei hăng nao pơ Yêsu.
But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying, Rabbi, eat. @ Tơdang anŭn, ƀing ding kơna pơđur kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, ƀơ̆ng huă bĕ.”
But he said to them, I have food to eat which ye do not know. @ Samơ̆ Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo hmâo gơnam ƀơ̆ng huă samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu thâo ôh.”
The disciples therefore said to one another, Has any one brought him [anything] to eat? @ Tui anŭn ƀing ding kơna bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu pô: “Hmâo hlơi ba mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă kơ Ñu hă?”
Jesus says to them, My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing gơ̆: “Mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă Kâo jing ngă tui hăng tơlơi kiăng Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo, hăng ngă pơgiơ̆ng hĭ bruă Ñu. 
Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the harvest comes?

But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, He told me all things that I had ever done. @ Hmâo lu ƀing Samari amăng plei anŭn đaŏ kơ Yêsu, yua kơ tơlơi đah kơmơi anŭn hmâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan: “Ñu hmâo laĭ djơ̆ abih bang tơlơi kâo hmâo ngă.” 
When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to abide with them, and he abode there two days. @ Tui anŭn tơ ƀing Samari nao pơ Yêsu, gơñu rơkâo kơ Yêsu dŏ glaĭ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu, laih anŭn Yêsu dŏ glaĭ pơ anŭn dua hrơi.
And more a great deal believed on account of his word; @ Hmâo mơnuih đaŏ lu hloh dơ̆ng yua kơ tơlơi Yêsu pơtô. 
and they said to the woman, [It is] no longer on account of thy saying that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world. @ Gơñu laĭ kơ đah kơmơi anŭn: “Ră anai gơmơi đaŏ ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi ih ngă gơ̆ng jơlan ôh, samơ̆ yua kơ gơmơi pô hmâo hmư̆ laih, hăng thâo sĭt Ñu yơh jing Pô Pơklaih lŏn tơnah.”
But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee, @ Dua hrơi mơ̆ng anŭn, Yêsu lui anih anŭn nao pơ kwar Galilê; 
for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country. @ yua kơ Yêsu pô hmâo laĭ pơsĭt, arăng ƀu pơpŭ pơyom ôh sa čô pô laĭ lui hlâo amăng plei ñu pô. 
When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast, for they also went to the feast. @ Tơ Ñu truh pơ kwar Galilê, ƀing mơnuih Galilê mơak čơkă jum Ñu, yua kơ gơñu hmâo ƀuh abih bang tơlơi Ñu hmâo ngă amăng plei Yêrusalem ƀơi hrơi phĕt Tơlơi Găn, yua kơ wơ̆t gơñu mơ̆n hmâo nao kơ tơlơi phĕt anŭn.
He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick. @ Tui anŭn Yêsu wơ̆t glaĭ dơ̆ng pơ plei Kana amăng kwar Galilê, anih Ñu hmâo hrih ia ƀlăng jing tơpai.

He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him and asked [him] that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die. @ Tơ khua anŭn hmư̆ Yêsu tơbiă rai mơ̆ng kwar Yuđa nao pơ kwar Galilê, ñu nao pơ Yêsu hăng rơkâo kơ Gơ̆ nao pơ plei Kapernum pơsuaih ană đah rơkơi ñu, yua kơ gơ̆ ruă giăm či djai. 
Jesus therefore said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe. @ Tui anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Tơdah ƀing gih ƀu ƀuh ôh gru kơnăl mơyang hăng tơlơi mơsêh mơyang, ƀing gih ƀu či đaŏ ôh.”
The courtier says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die. @ Khua anŭn laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua, rơkâo kơ Ih rai bĕ hlâo kơ ană kâo djai.”
Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Nao bĕ, ană đah rơkơi ih či hơdip.” Pô anŭn đaŏ kơ tơlơi Yêsu hmâo laĭ kơ ñu, gơ̆ glaĭ yơh. 
But already, as he was going down, his servants met him and brought [him] word saying, Thy child lives. @ Tơdang ñu dŏ rơbat ƀơi jơlan, ƀing ding kơna ñu nao čơkă ñu hăng laĭ: “Ană đah rơkơi ih ăt dŏ hơdip.”
He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. @ Tui anŭn pô khua tơña kơ gơñu hlăk hơdôm mông ană ñu suaih. Gơñu laĭ: “Tơ̆m brơi hlăk sa mông klam tơlơi duăm rơŏt ñu abih.” 
The father therefore knew that [it was] in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house. @ Pô ama anŭn thâo djơ̆ ƀơi mông anŭn yơh Yêsu hmâo laĭ kơ ñu: “Ană đah rơkơi ih či hơdip” Tui anŭn ñu hăng abih bang sang anŏ ñu đaŏ yơh.
This second sign again did Jesus, being come out of Judaea into Galilee. @ Anai jing tơlơi mơsêh mơyang tal dua Yêsu hmâo ngă tơdơi kơ Ñu tơbiă mơ̆ng kwar Yuđa glaĭ pơ kwar Galilê.
After these things was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn hmâo hrơi phĕt ƀing ană Yuđa, Yêsu đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
Now there is in Jerusalem, at the sheepgate, a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches. @ Amăng plei Yêrusalem jĕ amăng jang Triu hmâo sa dơnao ia hmâo rơma boh adring, amăng tơlơi Hêbrơ arăng iâu Bêtesda.

But there was a certain man there who had been suffering under his infirmity thirty and eight years. @ Ƀơi anŭn hmâo sa čô đah rơkơi ruă klâo pluh sapăn thŭn laih. 
Jesus seeing this [man] lying [there], and knowing that he was [in that state] now a great length of time, says to him, Wouldest thou become well? @ Yêsu ƀuh ñu hăng thâo kơ ñu dŏ đih pơ anŭn sui thŭn laih, hnŭn yơh Yêsu tơña kơ ñu: “Ih kiăng suaih mơ̆?”
The infirm [man] answered him, Sir, I have not a man, in order, when the water has been troubled, to cast me into the pool; but while I am coming another descends before me. @ Mơnuih ruă anŭn laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua, hlăk ia tơglăk kâo ƀu hmâo ôh mơnuih djru glŏm kâo amăng dơnao ia; tơdang kâo gir trŭn hmâo laih mơnuih pơkŏn trŭn hlâo kơ kâo.”
Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch and walk. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Tơgŭ bĕ, mă kiao ih hăng rơbat nao.” 
And immediately the man became well, and took up his couch and walked: and on that day was sabbath. @ Mơnuih anŭn suaih mơtam yơh. Ñu mă kiao hăng rơbat nao.
Hlăk anŭn jing hrơi Saƀat. 
The Jews therefore said to the healed [man], It is sabbath, it is not permitted thee to take up thy couch. @ Tui anŭn ƀing Yuđa laĭ kơ mơnuih phrâo suaih anŭn: “Hrơi anai jing hrơi Saƀat, ih ƀu dưi glăm ba kiao ih ôh.”

They asked him [therefore], Who is the man who said to thee, Take up thy couch and walk? @ Gơñu tơña kơ gơ̆: “Hlơi laĭ kơ ih ‘glăm ba kiao ih hăng rơbat nao?’”
But he that had been healed knew not who it was, for Jesus had slidden away, there being a crowd in the place. @ Mơnuih phrâo suaih anŭn ƀu thâo krăn ôh hlơi pô hmâo pơsuaih ñu, yua kơ Yêsu hmâo sek mŭt amăng mơnuih lu pơ anŭn.
After these things Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art become well: sin no more, that something worse do not happen to thee. @ Sui ƀiă kơ anŭn Yêsu bưp pô anŭn amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, hăng laĭ kơ ñu: “Hơi, ih hmâo suaih laih.

The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well. @ Pô anŭn nao laĭ pơthâo kơ ƀing Yuđa, Yêsu yơh hmâo pơsuaih ñu. 
And for this the Jews persecuted Jesus [and sought to kill him], because he had done these things on sabbath. @ Ƀing Yuđa čơdơ̆ng ngă sat kơ Yêsu yua kơ Ñu hmâo pơsuaih mơnuih amăng hrơi saƀat. 
But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto and I work. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Ama Kâo ăt mă bruă truh pơ ră anai, Kâo ăt mă bruă tui anŭn mơ̆n.”
For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he had not only violated the sabbath, but also said that God was his own Father, making himself equal with God. @ Yua kơ tơlơi anŭn yơh, ƀing Yuđa jai kơtang hloh hơduah jơlan kiăng pơdjai Ñu, yua kơ ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng Ñu gao hrơi saƀat đôč ôh samơ̆ wơ̆t yua kơ Ñu iâu Ơi Adai jing Ama Ñu, Ñu yap Ñu pô bơmơđơr hăng Ơi Adai.
Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself save whatever he sees the Father doing: for whatever things *he* does, these things also the Son does in like manner. @ Tui anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih sĭt biă mă, Ană ƀu dưi ngă sa mơta bruă tui hăng Ñu pô kiăng ôh, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng ngă tơlơi Ñu ƀuh Ama ngă. Yua kơ bruă hơgĕt Ama ngă, Ană ăt ngă kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
For the Father loves the Son and shews him all things which he himself does; and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may wonder. @ Yua kơ Ama khăp kơ Ană hăng pơrơđah brơi Ană abih bang bruă Ñu ngă. Laih anŭn Ñu či pơrơđah kơ Ană bruă prŏng hloh kơ khul bruă anai dơ̆ng, kiăng kơ ƀing gih kơtuă hling. 
For even as the Father raises the dead and quickens [them], thus the Son also quickens whom he will: @ Kar hăng Ama hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ ƀing mơnuih djai hăng brơi tơlơi hơdip kơ gơñu, ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n Ană brơi tơlơi hơdip kơ hlơi pô Ñu kiăng. 
for neither does the Father judge any one, but has given all judgment to the Son; @ Ama ƀu phat kơđi kơ hlơi hlơi ôh, samơ̆ Ñu hmâo jao abih tơlơi phat kơđi anŭn kơ Ană Ñu, 
that all may honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He who honours not the Son, honours not the Father who has sent him. @ kiăng kơ abih bang mơnuih leng kơ pơpŭ kơ Ană, kar hăng gơñu pơpŭ kơ Ama mơ̆n. Hlơi pô ƀu pơpŭ kơ Ană, kŏn pơpŭ kơ Ama lơi, jing Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Ñu.”
Verily, verily, I say unto you, that he that hears my word, and believes him that has sent me, has life eternal, and does not come into judgment, but is passed out of death into life. @ “Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih sĭt biă mă, hlơi pô hmư̆ boh pơhiăp Kâo hăng đaŏ kơ pô pơkiaŏ rai Kâo, ñu anŭn hmâo tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar; ñu ƀu či tŭ tơlơi phat kơđi ôh, samơ̆ ñu găn tơlơi djai laih anŭn mŭt amăng tơlơi hơdip. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that have heard shall live. @ Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih sĭt biă mă, mông jĕ truh, laih anŭn hmâo truh laih, tơ ƀing djai či hmư̆ hiăp Ană Ơi Adai; laih anŭn ƀing hmư̆ hiăp Ñu či hơdip. 
For even as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself, @ Yua kơ kar hăng Ama hmâo tơlơi hơdip amăng Ñu Pô, kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n Ñu brơi kơ Ană hmâo tơlơi hơdip amăng Ñu Pô. 
and has given him authority to execute judgment [also], because he is Son of man. @ Laih anŭn Ama hmâo brơi kơ Ană tơlơi dưi phat kơđi, yua kơ Gơ̆ jing Ană Mơnuih. 
Wonder not at this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear his voice, @ Anăm kơtuă hling ôh kơ tơlơi anŭn; yua kơ mông či truh tơ abih bang ƀing dŏ amăng pơsat či hmư̆ hiăp Ñu

I cannot do anything of myself; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I do not seek my will, but the will of him that has sent me. @ “Kâo ƀu dưi ngă hơgĕt bruă mơ̆ng Kâo pô ôh.

If I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is not true. @ “Tơdah Kâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơsĭt kơ Kâo pô, tơlơi Kâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan anŭn ƀu sĭt ôh.

But I have the witness [that is] greater than [that] of John; for the works which the Father has given me that I should complete them, the works themselves which I do, bear witness concerning me that the Father has sent me. @ Samơ̆ Kâo hmâo tơlơi ngă gơ̆ng jơlan prŏng hloh kơ tơlơi Yôhan gơ̆ng jơlan; yua kơ khul bruă Ama jao brơi Kâo khŏm ngă pơgiơ̆ng, khul bruă anŭn Kâo hlăk ngă ră anai, ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ Kâo kơ tơlơi Ama hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo. 
And the Father who has sent me himself has borne witness concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor have seen his shape, @ Laih anŭn Ama, Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo, ăt ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ Kâo. Ƀing gih aka hmư̆ djơ̆ ôh hiăp Ñu, kŏn ƀuh djơ̆ rup drơi jan Ñu lơi,

After these things Jesus went away beyond the sea of Galilee, [or] of Tiberias, @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu găn nao pơ hang gah dih ia rơsĭ Galilê, anăn pơkŏn dơ̆ng ia rơsĭ Tibêrias. 
and a great crowd followed him, because they saw the signs which he wrought upon the sick. @ Sa phung mơnuih lu đuaĭ tui Ñu, yua kơ gơñu hmâo ƀuh gru tơlơi mơsêh mơyang Yêsu pơsuaih ƀing mơnuih duăm ruă. 
And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there sat with his disciples: @ Yêsu đĭ pơ čư̆ laih anŭn dŏ ber pơ anŭn hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu. 
but the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near. @ Hrơi phĕt Tơlơi Găn ƀing ană Yuđa jĕ truh yơh. 
Jesus then, lifting up his eyes and seeing that a great crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these may eat? @ Tơdang Yêsu angak mơta Ñu ƀuh phung mơnuih lu rai pơ Ñu, Ñu laĭ kơ Philip: “Pơpă ƀing ta či blơi ƀañ tơpŭng, kiăng brơi ƀing mơnuih anai ƀơ̆ng?” 
But this he said trying him, for he knew what he was going to do. @ Yêsu laĭ tui anŭn kiăng lông lăng Philip, yua kơ Ñu thâo laih hơgĕt Ñu či ngă.
Philip answered him, Loaves for two hundred denarii are not sufficient for them, that each may have some little [portion]. @ Philip laĭ glaĭ: “Dua rơtuh đơniê blơi ƀañ tơpŭng wơ̆t dah pha brơi rĭm čô ƀơƀiă đôč ăt ƀu djŏp mơ̆n.”
One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, says to him, @ Sa čô amăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu, Andrê adơi Simôn Pêtrôs, laĭ kơ Yêsu, 
There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fishes; but this, what is it for so many? @ “Hmâo sa čô čơđai đah rơkơi hmâo rơma klŏ ƀañ tơpŭng pơdai ôrgơ hăng dua drơi akan; samơ̆ hyư̆m dưi djŏp kơ mơnuih lu lĭn anai?”
[And] Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place: the men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand. @ Yêsu laĭ: “Brơi ƀing ană plei dŏ ber bĕ.” Ƀơi anŭn hmâo lu rơ̆k. Tui anŭn ƀing gơñu dŏ ber. Hmâo năng ai rơma rơbâo čô đah rơkơi. 
And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed [them] to those that were set down; and in like manner of the small fishes as much as they would. @ Yêsu mă ƀañ tơpŭng, giơ̆ng Ñu bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai, Ñu pơpha brơi ƀing dŏ ber ƀơi anŭn. Ñu pơpha wơ̆t akan mơ̆n tui hăng hơdôm gơñu kiăng. 
And when they had been filled, he says to his disciples, Gather together the fragments which are over and above, that nothing may be lost. @ Giơ̆ng gơñu ƀơ̆ng trơi laih, Yêsu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Duñ bĕ čơđeh meh ƀañ tơpŭng, akan rơbeh, anăm pơrơngiă hĭ đôč đač ôh.” 
They gathered [them] therefore together, and filled twelve hand-baskets full of fragments of the five barley loaves, which were over and above to those that had eaten. @ Hnŭn yơh gơñu duñ abih čơđeh meh anŭn hmâo bă pluh dua bai čơđeh meh mơ̆ng rơma klŏ ƀañ tơpŭng pơdai ôrgơ anŏ arăng hmâo ƀơ̆ng laih.
The men therefore, having seen the sign which Jesus had done, said, This is truly the prophet which is coming into the world. @ Tơ ƀing ană plei ƀuh tơlơi mơsêh mơyang Yêsu hmâo ngă, gơñu laĭ: “Sĭt yơh Pô anai jing Pô laĭ lui hlâo, jing Pô khŏm rai amăng lŏn tơnah!” 
Jesus therefore knowing that they were going to come and seize him, that they might make [him] king, departed again to the mountain himself alone. @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu thâo gơñu či pơgŏ Ñu ngă pơtao, tui anŭn Ñu hơdeč đuaĭ pơ čư̆ dŏ hơjăn Ñu.
But when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea, @ Tơ klam truh, ƀing ding kơna Yêsu trŭn nao pơ ia rơsĭ, 
and having gone on board ship, they went over the sea to Capernaum. And it had already become dark, and Jesus had not come to them, @ đĭ amăng sa boh sŏng hăng čơdơ̆ng găn ia rơsĭ kiăng nao pơ plei Kapernum. Adai mơmŏt laih, samơ̆ Yêsu ăt aka nao truh pơ gơñu ôh. 
and the sea was agitated by a strong wind blowing. @ Ia rơsĭ čơdơ̆ng poh yă yua kơ hmâo angĭn thut kơtang. 
Having rowed then about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the ship; and they were frightened. @ Tơ gơñu waih sŏng nao năng ai rơma ƀôdah năm kilômet, gơñu ƀuh Yêsu rơbat ƀơi jơlah ia hăng rai jĕ pơ sŏng. Gơñu hwĭ. 
But he says to them, It is I: be not afraid. @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Anăm hwĭ ôh; Kâo gơ̆ yơh.” 
They were willing therefore to receive him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land to which they went. @ Laih anŭn gơñu mơak jum Yêsu đĭ amăng sŏng. Tañ mơtam sŏng truh pơ hang pơ anih gơñu kiăng nao.
On the morrow the crowd which stood on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other little ship there except that into which his disciples had got, and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the ship, but [that] his disciples had gone away alone; @ Hrơi tơdơi ƀing ană plei ăt dŏ ƀơi hang gah adih ia rơsĭ kơnơ̆ng ƀuh sa boh sŏng pơ anŭn, laih anŭn gơñu thâo Yêsu ƀu đĭ amăng sŏng hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu ôh kơnơ̆ng hơjăn ƀing ding kơna Ñu đôč nao.

Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, Ye seek me not because ye have seen signs, but because ye have eaten of the loaves and been filled. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih sĭt biă mă, ƀing gih hyu sem Kâo, ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ ƀing gih hmâo ƀuh tơlơi mơsêh mơyang ôh, samơ̆ yua ƀing gih hmâo ƀơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng trơi laih.

They said therefore to him, What should we do that we may work the works of God? @ Gơñu laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Hơgĕt gơmơi khŏm ngă, kiăng mă bruă kơ Ơi Adai?”
Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom *he* has sent. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Bruă Ơi Adai anŭn jing brơi ƀing gih đaŏ bĕ kơ Pô Ñu hmâo pơkiaŏ rai laih.”

The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How can he give us this flesh to eat? @ Yua kơ tơlơi anŭn ƀing ană Yuđa pơrơjah tơdruă gơñu hăng laĭ: “Hyư̆m mơnuih anai dưi brơi ƀing ta ƀơ̆ng asar ñu lĕ?”
Jesus therefore said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Unless ye shall have eaten the flesh of the Son of man, and drunk his blood, ye have no life in yourselves. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih sĭt biă mă, tơdah ƀing gih ƀu ƀơ̆ng ôh asar Ană Mơnuih hăng mơñum drah Ñu, ƀing gih ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar amăng ƀing gih ôh.

This is the bread which has come down out of heaven. Not as the fathers ate and died: he that eats this bread shall live for ever. @ Anai jing ƀañ tơpŭng trŭn rai mơ̆ng adai, ƀu djơ̆ hrup hăng ƀañ tơpŭng mana ƀing ơi adon ƀing gih ƀơ̆ng laih anŭn ăt djai mơ̆n; hlơi pô ƀơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng anai ñu či hơdip hlŏng lar.”
These things he said in [the] synagogue, teaching in Capernaum. @ Yêsu pơhiăp hơdôm tơlơi anai tơdang Ñu pơtô amăng sang bơjơnum pơ Plei Kapernum.
Many therefore of his disciples having heard [it] said, This word is hard; who can hear it? @ Lu ƀing ding kơna Ñu hmư̆ tơlơi anai, gơñu laĭ “Boh pơhiăp anai tơnap đơi thâo hluh. Hlơi pô dưi hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn?”
But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmur concerning this, said to them, Does this offend you? @ Samơ̆ Yêsu thâo yơh amăng pran jua Ñu kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu pơhiăp brŏk kơ tơlơi anŭn, hnŭn yơh Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ tơlơi anai ngă tơhnač ƀing gih?

It is the Spirit which quickens, the flesh profits nothing: the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life. @ Yang Bơngăt Ơi Adai yơh jing pô brơi tơlơi hơdip, asar ƀu yom ôh; khul boh pơhiăp Kâo hmâo pơhiăp hăng ƀing gih jing Yang Bơngăt laih anŭn tơlơi hơdip. 
But there are some of you who do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would deliver him up. @ Samơ̆ hmâo đơđa mơnuih amăng ƀing gih ƀu đaŏ ôh.” Yua kơ Yêsu thâo laih mơ̆ng blŭng hlâo hlơi jing ƀing mơnuih ƀu đaŏ, laih anŭn hlơi jing pô či pơblư̆ lui Ñu. 
And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no one can come to me unless it be given to him from the Father. @ Laih anŭn Ñu laĭ: “Yua kơ anŭn kâo hmâo laĭ laih kơ ƀing gih, ƀu hmâo ôh hlơi dưi rai pơ Kâo tơdah Ama ƀu brơi tơlơi dưi kơ ñu.”
From that [time] many of his disciples went away back and walked no more with him. @ Mă mơ̆ng anŭn, lu ƀing ding kơna Ñu đuaĭ glaĭ ƀu nao hrŏm hăng Yêsu dơ̆ng ôh. 
Jesus therefore said to the twelve, Will ye also go away? @ Yêsu laĭ hăng pluh dua čô ding kơna: “Bơ ƀing gih, ƀing gih či lui kâo mơ̆n hă?”
Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast words of life eternal; @ Simôn Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua, kơ hlơi ƀing gơmơi či đuaĭ tui? Ih yơh hmâo boh pơhiăp kơ tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar. 
and we have believed and known that thou art the holy one of God. @ Ƀing gơmơi hmâo đaŏ laih hăng thâo krăn Ih jing Pô Rơgoh Hiam mơ̆ng Ơi Adai.”
Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you the twelve? and of you one is a devil. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă Kâo hmâo ruah laih ƀing gih jing pluh dua čô ding kơna, samơ̆ sa čô amăng ƀing gih jing yang sat?” 
Now he spoke of Judas [the son] of Simon, Iscariote, for he [it was who] should deliver him up, being one of the twelve. @ Ñu pơhiăp djơ̆ kơ Yudas ană đah rơkơi Simôn Iskariôt, yua kơ ñu jing sa čô amăng ƀing pluh dua čô ding kơna, pô či pơblư̆ lui Yêsu.
And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him. @ Tơdơi kơ tơlơi anŭn, Yêsu hyu amăng tring Galilê. Ñu ƀu hyu ôh amăng kwar Yuđa yua kơ ƀing ană Yuđa hơduah kiăng pơdjai Ñu. 
Now the tabernacles, the feast of the Jews, was near. @ Phĕt Sang Khăn ƀing ană Yuđa jĕ truh. 
His brethren therefore said to him, Remove hence and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou doest; @ Tui anŭn ƀing adơi Yêsu laĭ kơ Ñu: “Tơbiă bĕ mơ̆ng anih anai hăng nao pơ tring Yuđa, kiăng kơ ƀing ding kơna ih dưi ƀuh bruă ih ngă. 
for no one does anything in secret and himself seeks to be [known] in public. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world: @ Yua kơ ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô mă bruă hơgơ̆m tơdah ñu kiăng kơ arăng thâo krăn ñu. Tơdah ih ngă hơdôm bruă anŭn, pơrơđah bĕ ih pô kơ mơnuih lŏn tơnah thâo.” 
for neither did his brethren believe on him. @ Yua kơ wơ̆t ƀing adơi Ñu kŏn đaŏ kơ Ñu lơi.
Jesus therefore says to them, My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready. @ Yêsu laĭ hăng gơñu: “Mông kâo aka truh ôh, samơ̆ ƀing gih hmâo mông gal nanao. 
The world cannot hate you, but me it hates, because I bear witness concerning it that its works are evil. @ Lŏn tơnah ƀu bơrơmŭt kơ ƀing gih ôh, samơ̆ lŏn tơnah bơrơmŭt kơ kâo, yua kơ kâo pơhaih bruă gơñu ngă jing soh sat.

Having said these things to them he abode in Galilee. @ Pơhiăp giơ̆ng, Ñu ăt dŏ glaĭ amăng tring Galilê.
But when his brethren had gone up, then he himself also went up to the feast, not openly, but as in secret. @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing adơi Ñu nao laih kơ hrơi phĕt, tơdơi kơ anŭn Ñu pô ăt nao mơ̆n, samơ̆ Ñu nao hăng tơlơi hơgơ̆m ƀu brơi ƀing mơnuih lu thâo ôh. 
The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? @ Ƀing Yuđa hyu sem Yêsu amăng anih tơlơi phĕt anŭn hăng laĭ: “Pơpă Ñu?”
And there was much murmuring concerning him among the crowds. Some said, He is [a] good [man]; others said, No; but he deceives the crowd. @ Lu ƀing ană plei pơhiăp phač djơ̆ kơ Ñu tơdang hmâo đơđa mơnuih laĭ: “Ñu jing sa čô mơnuih hiam,” ƀing pơkŏn laĭ: “Ư ưh, Ñu jing mơnuih plư pleč ană plei.” 
However, no one spoke openly concerning him on account of [their] fear of the Jews. @ Samơ̆ ƀu hmâo hlơi khĭn pơhiăp rơđah ôh yua kơ hwĭ kơ ƀing khua ană Yuđa.
But when it was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught. @ Hlăk tơ̆ng krah hrơi phĕt, Yêsu nao pơ sang kơkuh pơpŭ laih anŭn pơtô laĭ. 
The Jews therefore wondered, saying, How knows this [man] letters, having never learned? @ Ƀing Yuđa kơtuă hling kơ tơlơi anŭn hăng laĭ: “Hyư̆m mơnuih anai dưi thâo Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp lu tui anŭn, Ñu aka hrăm djơ̆ ôh?”
Jesus therefore answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but [that] of him that has sent me. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơlơi Kâo pơtô ƀu djơ̆ mơ̆ng Kâo pô ôh samơ̆ mơ̆ng Pô pơkiaŏ rai Kâo. 
If any one desire to practise his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is of God, or [that] I speak from myself. @ Tơdah sa čô mơnuih mơak pran jua kiăng ngă tui hăng tơlơi Ơi Adai kiăng, ñu či thâo yơh tơlơi Kâo pơtô tơbiă rai mơ̆ng Ơi Adai ƀôdah mơ̆ng Kâo pô. 
He that speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he that seeks the glory of him that has sent him, he is true, and unrighteousness is not in him. @ Hlơi pô pơhiăp tui hăng tơlơi dưi ñu pô, sem hơduah tơlơi ư-ang kơ ñu pô; samơ̆ hlơi pô sem hơduah tơlơi ư-ang kơ pô pơkiaŏ rai ñu, ñu jing pô tơpă sĭt, laih anŭn amăng ñu ƀu hmâo tơlơi plơ̆m ƀlor ôh. 
Has not Moses given you the law, and no one of you practises the law? Why do ye seek to kill me? @ Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă Môis hmâo brơi laih tơlơi juăt kơ ƀing gih? Samơ̆ ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô amăng ƀing gih gưt ngă tui tơlơi juăt. Hyư̆m ƀing gih sem hơduah kiăng pơdjai Kâo lĕ?”
The crowd answered [and said], Thou hast a demon: who seeks to kill thee? @ Ƀing ană plei laĭ glaĭ: “Amăng ih hmâo yang sat! Hlơi hơduah sem kiăng pơdjai ih?”
Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all wonder. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo hmâo ngă laih sa mơta bruă, laih anŭn abih bang ƀing gih dŏ kơtuă hling yua kơ bruă anŭn. 
Therefore Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and ye circumcise a man on sabbath. @ Môis brơi kơ ƀing gih tơlơi juăt khăt klĭ.

Some therefore of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? @ Hmâo đơđa mơnuih amăng plei Yêrusalem laĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă pô anai yơh arăng hơduah kiăng pơdjai? 
and behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers then indeed recognised that this is the Christ? @ Lăng adih, Ñu dŏ pơtô hăng tơlơi rơngai ƀơi anăp abih bang mơnuih, laih anŭn arăng ƀu laĭ tơlơi hơgĕt kơ Ñu ôh.

But [as to] this [man] we know whence he is. Now [as to] the Christ, when he comes, no one knows whence he is. @ Samơ̆ tơ Yang Krist či rai ƀu hmâo hlơi pô thâo mơ̆ng pơpă Ñu rai ôh. Bơ mơnuih anai ƀing ta thâo laih mơ̆ng pơpă ñu tơbiă rai.”
Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me and ye know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye do not know. @ Hlăk Yêsu dŏ pơtô amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, Ñu pơhiăp kraih: “Ƀing gih thâo krăn laih Kâo, laih anŭn ƀing gih ăt thâo mơ̆n mơ̆ng pơpă Kâo rai.

They sought therefore to take him; and no one laid his hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come. @ Tui anŭn, gơñu hơduah jơlan kiăng mă Yêsu, samơ̆ ƀu hmâo hlơi pô dưi yơr tơngan ruaih Ñu ôh, yua kơ mông Ñu aka truh. 
But many of the crowd believed on him, and said, Will the Christ, when he comes, do more signs than those which this [man] has done? @ Samơ̆ hmâo lu mơnuih đaŏ kơ Ñu laih anŭn gơñu laĭ: “Tơ Yang Krist truh, Ñu či ngă lu gru kơnăl mơyang hloh kơ pô anai hmâo ngă laih mơ̆?”
The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things concerning him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers that they might take him. @ Ƀing Pharisi hmư̆ ƀing mơnuih lu pơhiăp phač djơ̆ kơ Yêsu. Tui anŭn gơñu hăng ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng pơkiaŏ ƀing tơhan gak wai sang kơkuh pơpŭ nao mă Yêsu. 
Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while I am with you, and I go to him that has sent me. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh Yêsu laĭ: “Kâo či dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing gih sui ƀiă dơ̆ng, giơ̆ng anŭn Kâo či glaĭ pơ Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo.

The Jews therefore said to one another, Where is he about to go that we shall not find him? Is he about to go to the dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? @ Ƀing Yuđa bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu: “Pơpă pô anai pơmĭn kiăng nao tơl ƀing ta ƀu či ƀuh Ñu ôh?

In the last, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried saying, If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink. @ Ƀơi hrơi hnal tuč jing hrơi yom hloh amăng hrơi phĕt anŭn, Yêsu dŏ dơ̆ng hăng pơhiăp kraih tui anai: “Hlơi pô mơhao, brơi ñu rai bĕ pơ Kâo laih anŭn mơñum.

But this he said concerning the Spirit, which they that believed on him were about to receive; for [the] Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. @ Yêsu laĭ tơlơi anŭn kiăng laĭ nao kơ Yang Bơngăt Hiam, kơ hlơi pô đaŏ kơ Ñu či tŭ mă.

Others said, This is the Christ. Others said, Does then the Christ come out of Galilee? @ Ƀing pơkŏn laĭ: “Anai yơh Yang Krist.” Samơ̆ đơđa laĭ: “Yang Krist ƀu tơbiă rai mơ̆ng tring Galilê ôh.

There was a division therefore in the crowd on account of him. @ Tui anŭn hmâo tơlơi pơkah pha phung tơ̆ng krah ƀing ană plei yua kơ Yêsu. 
But some of them desired to take him, but no one laid hands upon him. @ Đơđa ƀing gơñu kiăng mă čaŏ Yêsu, samơ̆ ƀu hmâo hlơi ruaih djơ̆ Ñu ôh.

The officers answered, Never man spoke thus, as this man [speaks]. @ Ƀing khua tơhan laĭ glaĭ: “Aka hmâo djơ̆ ôh mơnuih pơhiăp kar hăng pô anai!”
The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also deceived? @ Ƀing Pharisi laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Wơ̆t kơ ƀing gih ăt lĕ tơlơi Ñu plư mơ̆n hă? 
Has any one of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? @ Hmâo mơ̆ hlơi amăng ƀing khua ană Yuđa ƀôdah ƀing mơnuih Pharisi đaŏ kơ Ñu?

They answered and said to him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and look, that no prophet arises out of Galilee. @ Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Hyư̆m ih ăt jing mơnuih Galilê mơ̆n hă? Brơi ih kơsem lăng bĕ Hră Ơi Adai, ih či ƀuh ƀu hmâo sa čô pô laĭ lui hlâo tơbiă rai mơ̆ng tring Galilê ôh.” [
And every one went to his home. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn abih bang gơñu glaĭ pơ sang gơñu pô.
But Jesus went to the mount of Olives. @ Yêsu đĭ nao pơ Čư̆ Ôliwơ. 
And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them. @ Ưm mơguah, Yêsu wơ̆t glaĭ pơ sang kơkuh pơpŭ dơ̆ng. Abih bang ƀing ană plei leng kơ nao pơ Ñu. Laih anŭn Ñu dŏ ber pơtô ƀing gơ̆. 
And the scribes and the Pharisees bring [to him] a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst, @ Ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt hăng ƀing Pharisi ba rai sa čô đah kơmơi arăng hmâo mă tơdang gơ̆ klĕ pyu hăng pioh ñu dŏ ƀơi tơ̆ng krah mơnuih lu, 
they say to him, Teacher, this woman has been taken in the very act, committing adultery. @ hăng laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, đah kơmơi anai arăng hmâo mă ñu tơdang ñu dŏ klĕ pyu. 
Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such; thou therefore, what sayest thou? @ Amăng tơlơi juăt Môis pơtă brơi ƀing ta khŏm glŏm boh pơtâo pơdjai hĭ pô ngă kar hăng tui anŭn. Bơ Ih hyư̆m Ih laĭ kơ tơlơi anŭn?” 
But this they said proving him, that they might have [something] to accuse him [of]. But Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his finger on the ground. @ Gơñu laĭ tui anŭn kiăng lông lăng Yêsu kiăng kơ hmâo tơlơi dưi phong kơ Ñu. Yêsu tơkui čih hăng čơđeng Ñu ƀơi lŏn. 
But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her. @ Yua kơ ƀing anŭn tơña nanao kơ Ñu dơ̆ng, dŏ tơña lu tơlơi, Ñu angak mơta hăng laĭ: “Hlơi amăng ƀing gih jing mơnuih ƀu hmâo tơlơi soh ôh, brơi ñu blŭng hlâo mă boh pơtâo glŏm đah kơmơi anai.” 
And again stooping down he wrote on the ground. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Yêsu tơkui čih ƀơi lŏn dơ̆ng. 
But they, having heard [that], went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last; and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there. @ Tơ gơñu hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơñu ƀrư̆ ƀrư̆ pha drơi pha đuaĭ, ƀing tha đuaĭ hlâo.

And Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee? @ Yêsu angak mơta hăng laĭ kơ đah kơmơi anŭn: “Pơpă ƀing pơčŭt kơ ih lĕ? Ƀu hmâo hlơi klă kơđi kơ ih ôh hă?”
And she said, No one, sir. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. @ Đah kơmơi anŭn laĭ: “Ơ Khua, ƀu hmâo ôh.”
Yêsu laĭ: “Kâo kŏn klă kơđi ih lơi. Nao bĕ, anăm ngă soh dơ̆ng ôh.”]
Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. @ Yêsu pơhiăp dơ̆ng hăng ƀing gơñu: “Kâo jing tơlơi bơngač kơ lŏn tơnah, hlơi pô đuaĭ tui kâo ñu ƀu či rơbat amăng tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt ôh, samơ̆ či hmâo tơlơi bơngač kơ tơlơi hơdip.”
The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true. @ Ƀing Pharisi laĭ kơ Ñu: “Ih ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ Ih pô, tơlơi Ih ngă gơ̆ng jơlan anŭn ƀu jing sĭt ôh.”
Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and whither I go. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Wơ̆t dah Kâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan mă Kâo pô, tơlơi Kâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan jing sĭt, yua kơ Kâo thâo mơ̆ng pơpă Kâo rai hăng pơpă anih Kâo nao; samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu thâo ôh mơ̆ng pă Kâo rai ƀôdah pơpă anih Kâo nao. 
Ye judge according to the flesh, I judge no one. @ Ƀing gih phat kơđi tui hăng mơnuih đôč, bơ Kâo ƀu hmâo phat kơđi kơ hlơi hlơi ôh. 
And if also I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who has sent me. @ Samơ̆ wơ̆t dah Kâo phat kơđi, tơlơi Kâo phat kơđi jing sĭt, yua kơ Kâo ƀu phat kơđi hơjăn Kâo đôč ôh, samơ̆ Kâo hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ama Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai laih Kâo. 
And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true: @ Amăng tơlơi juăt ƀing gih hmâo čih laih, dua čô ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kah jing sĭt. 
I am [one] who bear witness concerning myself, and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me. @ Kâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơsĭt kơ Kâo pô laih anŭn Ama jing Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo ăt ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơsĭt kơ Kâo mơ̆n.”
They said to him therefore, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father. @ Tui anŭn gơñu tơña kơ Yêsu: “Pơpă Ama Ih?”
Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih ƀu thâo krăn Kâo ôh, ăt ƀing gih ƀu thâo krăn Ama Kâo lơi. Tơdah ƀing gih thâo krăn Kâo, ƀing gih ăt thâo krăn Ama Kâo mơ̆n.”
These words spoke he in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one took him, for his hour was not yet come. @ Yêsu pơhiăp khul tơlơi anai amăng anih pioh hip pơyơr prăk, tơdang Ñu pơtô amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ. Samơ̆ ƀu hmâo hlơi pô mă čaŏ Ñu, yua kơ mông Ñu aka truh ôh.
He said therefore again to them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin; where I go ye cannot come. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu dơ̆ng: “Kâo či nao, ƀing gih či sem Kâo, samơ̆ ƀing gih či djai amăng tơlơi soh ƀing gih. Anih Kâo nao, ƀing gih ƀu dưi nao ôh.”
The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I go ye cannot come? @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh ƀing khua ană Yuđa laĭ: “Hyư̆m, Ñu či pơdjai Ñu pô hă, yua kơ Ñu laĭ: ‘Anih Kâo nao ƀing gih ƀu dưi nao ôh?’”
And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above. Ye are of this world; I am not of this world. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih tơbiă rai mơ̆ng gah yŭ, bơ Kâo trŭn rai mơ̆ng glong. Ƀing gih tơbiă mơ̆ng lŏn tơnah anai, bơ Kâo ƀu tơbiă rai mơ̆ng lŏn tơnah anai ôh.

They said therefore to him, Who art thou? [And] Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also say to you. @ Gơñu tơña kơ Yêsu: “Hlơi Ih jing?”
Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Hrup hăng Kâo hmâo laĭ laih hăng ƀing gih mơ̆ng phŭn blŭng.

They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father. @ Gơñu ƀu thâo hluh ôh Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn laĭ nao kơ Ama brơi kơ gơñu. 
Jesus therefore said to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things. @ Yua kơ anŭn, Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Tơ ƀing gih yol đĭ Ană Mơnuih hăng glong, hlăk anŭn ƀing gih či thâo yơh Kâo Jing Pô Kâo Jing, hăng thâo Kâo ƀu ngă hơgĕt tơlơi mơ̆ng tơlơi dưi Kâo pô ôh, samơ̆ Kâo kơnơ̆ng pơhiăp tui hăng hơgĕt tơlơi Ama hmâo pơtô brơi.

As he spoke these things many believed on him. @ Yua kơ Yêsu pơhiăp hơdôm tơlơi anŭn, hmâo lu mơnuih đaŏ kơ Ñu.
Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples; @ Hnŭn yơh Yêsu laĭ hăng ƀing ană Yuđa đaŏ laih kơ Ñu: “Tơdah ƀing gih dŏ kơjăp nanao amăng boh pơhiăp Kâo, sĭt ƀing gih jing ding kơna Kâo. 
and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free. @ Ƀing gih či thâo tơlơi sĭt laih anŭn tơlơi sĭt či pơrơngai ƀing gih.”
They answered him, We are Abraham's seed, and have never been under bondage to any one; how sayest thou, Ye shall become free? @ Ƀing ană Yuđa laĭ glaĭ: “Gơmơi jing ană tơčo Abraham, laih anŭn gơmơi aka ngă djơ̆ hlŭn kơ arăng ôh. Hyư̆m tơlơi Ih laĭ: ‘Ƀing gih či dưi jing rơngai’?”
Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo laĭ sĭt biă mă kơ ƀing gih, hlơi pô ngă soh ñu jing hlŭn kơ tơlơi soh. 
Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son abides for ever. @ Hlŭn ƀu dŏ nanao amăng sang ôh samơ̆ ană dŏ nanao amăng sang. 
If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free. @ Tui anŭn tơdah Ană pơrơngai ƀing gih, ƀing gih či jing rơngai sĭt yơh.

They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham; @ Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Abraham jing ama ƀing gơmơi.”
Yêsu laĭ: “Tơdah ƀing gih jing ană Abraham, ƀing gih či ngă tơlơi Abraham hmâo ngă laih.

Ye do the works of your father. They said [therefore] to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, God. @ Ƀing gih hlăk dŏ ngă khul tơlơi ama ƀing gih ngă.” Gơñu laĭ: “Ƀing gơmơi ƀu djơ̆ ană ƀă pôm ôh. Gơmơi kơnơ̆ng hmâo sa čô Ama đôč, jing Ơi Adai.” 
Jesus said to them, If God were your father ye would have loved me, for I came forth from God and am come [from him]; for neither am I come of myself, but *he* has sent me. @ Yêsu laĭ: “Tơdah Ơi Adai jing Ama ƀing gih, ƀing gih či khăp yơh kơ Kâo, yua kơ Kâo rai mơ̆ng Ơi Adai, laih anŭn ră anai Kâo dŏ pơ anai.

Ye are of the devil, as [your] father, and ye desire to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks falsehood, he speaks of what is his own; for he is a liar and its father: @ Ƀing gih tơbiă rai mơ̆ng ama ƀing gih jing Yang Sat, laih anŭn ƀing gih kiăng ngă tui hăng tơlơi ama ƀing gih kiăng.

The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon? @ Ƀing ană Yuđa laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Gơmơi laĭ Ih jing mơnuih Samari hăng pô hmâo yang sat ngă, anŭn ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă?”
Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ƀu djơ̆ yang sat ngă ôh; Samơ̆ Kâo pơpŭ kơ Ama Kâo, laih anŭn ƀing gih ƀu pơpŭ kơ Kâo ôh. 
But I do not seek my own glory: there is he that seeks and judges. @ Kâo ƀu sem hơduah tơlơi ư-ang kơ Kâo pô ôh. Hmâo laih Pô sem hơduah kơ tơlơi anŭn laih anŭn jing Pô phat kơđi.

The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham has died, and the prophets, and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he shall never taste death. @ Ƀing ană Yuđa laĭ: “Ră anai gơmơi thâo kơ Ih jing sa čô yang sat ngă.

Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me, [of] whom ye say, He is our God. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơdah Kâo pơ-ư pơang kơ Kâo pô, tơlơi ư-ang kơ Kâo pô anŭn jing đôč đač.

Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Sĭt biă mă Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih, hlâo kơ hmâo Abraham, hmâo Kâo laih.”
They took up therefore stones that they might cast [them] at him; but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple, [going through the midst of them, and thus passed on.] @ Hnŭn yơh gơñu mă boh pơtâo kiăng glŏm Yêsu; samơ̆ Yêsu sek đuaĭ hăng tơbiă hĭ mơ̆ng sang kơkuh pơpŭ.
And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth. @ Tơdang Yêsu rơbat nao, Ñu ƀuh sa čô mơnuih bum mơta mơ̆ng hrơi amĭ tơkeng. 
And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this [man] or his parents, that he should be born blind? @ Ƀing ding kơna tơña kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Nai, tơlơi soh hlơi ngă kơ ñu bum mơta anai; tơlơi soh ñu, ƀôdah tơlơi soh amĭ ama ñu?”
Jesus answered, Neither has this [man] sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi ñu ƀôdah tơlơi soh amĭ ama ñu ôh, samơ̆ kiăng kơ bruă Ơi Adai dưi pơrơđah amăng ñu.

Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes. @ Pơhiăp giơ̆ng, Yêsu kơčuh ia bah ƀơi lŏn, lŭk lŏn hăng ia bah Ñu jing hlŭ, laih anŭn pik ƀơi mơta pô bum anŭn. 
And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came seeing. @ Laih anŭn laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Nao rao bĕ pơ dơnao ia Silôê.” (Silôê kiăng pia “Arăng Pơkiaŏ Nao”). Tui anŭn gơ̆ nao rao laih anŭn wơ̆t glaĭ thâo ƀuh mơtam yơh.
The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was sitting and begging? @ Ƀing jum dar hăng ƀing hmâo ƀuh gơ̆ hlâo anŭn jing mơnuih rơkâo dan, laĭ: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ mơnuih anai jing pô juăt dŏ ber rơkâo gơnam arăng?”

They said therefore to him, How have thine eyes been opened? @ Gơñu tơña kơ gơ̆: “Tui anŭn hyư̆m mơta ih dưi ƀuh?” 
He answered [and said], A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw. @ Gơ̆ laĭ glaĭ: “Sa čô mơnuih anăn ñu Yêsu, hmâo lŭk hlŭ pik ƀơi mơta kâo hăng pơđar kâo: ‘Nao rao bĕ pơ ia dơnao Silôê.’ Tui anŭn kâo nao rao laih anŭn thâo ƀuh yơh.” 
They said therefore to him, Where is he? He says, I do not know. @ Gơñu tơña: “Pơpă ñu lĕ?” Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ƀu thâo ôh.”
They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees. @ Gơñu ba pô bum mơta hlâo dih nao pơ ƀing Pharisi. 
Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes. @ Hrơi Yêsu lŭk hlŭ hăng pơsuaih mơta pô bum anŭn jing hrơi saƀat. 
The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put mud upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see. @ Tui anŭn ƀing Pharisi tơña dơ̆ng kơ pô bum anŭn hyư̆m mơta ñu dưi thâo ƀuh. Pô bum laĭ glaĭ: “Ñu pik hlŭ ƀơi mơta kâo, kâo rao laih anŭn kâo thâo ƀuh yơh.”
Some of the Pharisees therefore said, This man is not of God, for he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man perform such signs? And there was a division among them. @ Hmâo mơnuih amăng ƀing Pharisi laĭ: “Mơnuih anai ƀu djơ̆ rai mơ̆ng Ơi Adai ôh, yua kơ ñu ƀu gưt tui tơlơi juăt hrơi saƀat ôh.”

They say therefore again to the blind [man], What dost thou say of him, that he has opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet. @ Tui anŭn gơñu tơña kơ pô bum anŭn dơ̆ng: “Bơ ih, hyư̆m ih laĭ kơ ñu jing, yua kơ ñu hmâo pơsuaih mơta ih.”
Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Ñu jing sa čô pô laĭ lui hlâo.”
The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight, until they had called the parents of him that had received sight. @ Samơ̆ ƀing khua ană Yuđa ƀu đaŏ ôh pô anŭn hlâo adih bum mơta, samơ̆ ră anai thâo ƀuh glaĭ, tơl gơñu iâu amĭ ama gơ̆ rai,

His parents answered [them] and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; @ Amĭ ama ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Gơmơi thâo anai jing ană đah rơkơi gơmơi, ñu bum mơta mơ̆ng hrơi tơkeng. 
but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his eyes we do not know. *He* is of age: ask *him*; *he* will speak concerning himself. @ Samơ̆ gơmơi ƀu thâo ôh hyư̆m ră anai ñu thâo ƀuh.

His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [to be the] Christ, he should be excommunicated from the synagogue. @ Amĭ ama ñu laĭ tui anŭn yua kơ gơñu hwĭ kơ ƀing khua ană Yuđa; yua kơ ƀing khua Yuđa hmâo tŭ ư hrŏm hơbĭt laih tơdah hlơi pô pơhaih hăng đaŏ kơ Yêsu jing Yang Krist, arăng či puh pơđuaĭ hĭ pô anŭn mơ̆ng sang bơjơnum. 
On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask *him*. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh amĭ ama ñu laĭ: “Ñu tha laih, tơña ñu bĕ!”
They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful. @ Gơñu iâu pô bum mơ̆ng hrơi amĭ tơkeng tal dua dơ̆ng hăng laĭ: “Brơi ih pơpŭ bơni kơ Ơi Adai bĕ! Gơmơi thâo mơnuih anŭn jing mơnuih soh.”
He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I know, that, being blind [before], now I see. @ Ñu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ƀu thâo ôh Ñu jing mơnuih soh, ƀôdah ƀu soh. Kâo kơnơ̆ng thâo sa tơlơi, hlâo adih kâo bum, ră anai kâo thâo ƀuh.”
And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how opened he thine eyes? @ Gơñu tơña dơ̆ng: “Hơgĕt ñu hmâo ngă laih kơ ih? Hyư̆m ñu hmâo pơsuaih laih mơta ih?”
He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear: why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his disciples? @ Gơ̆ laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo hmâo laĭ laih kơ ƀing gih, samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu kiăng hmư̆ ôh, hyư̆m ƀing gih kiăng hmư̆ dơ̆ng hă? Djơ̆ mơ̆ ƀing gih ăt kiăng jing ding kơna Ñu?”
They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses. @ Gơñu djik djak kơ gơ̆ hăng laĭ: “Ŏng yơh jing ding kơna ñu, gơmơi jing ding kơna Môis.

They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out. @ Gơñu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Arăng hmâo tơkeng laih ŏng amăng tơlơi soh, samơ̆ ŏng kiăng pơtô gơmơi hă?” Laih anŭn gơñu puh pơđuaĭ hĭ gơ̆ mơ̆ng sang bơjơnum.
Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God? @ Yêsu hmư̆ gơñu hmâo puh pơđuaĭ hĭ laih gơ̆ mơ̆ng sang bơjơnum. Yêsu nao bưp gơ̆ hăng laĭ: “Ih đaŏ kơ Ană Mơnuih mơ̆?”
He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him? @ Gơ̆ laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ khua, hlơi Ñu anŭn, kiăng kơ kâo dưi đaŏ kơ Ñu?”
And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Ih hmâo ƀuh Ñu laih, laih anŭn Ñu yơh pô pơhiăp hăng ih ră anai.”
And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage. @ Gơ̆ laĭ: “Ơ Khua, kâo đaŏ.” Laih anŭn ñu bon kơkuh ƀơi anăp Yêsu.
And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not may see, and they which see may become blind. @ Yêsu laĭ: “Kâo hmâo rai laih pơ lŏn tơnah kiăng phat kơđi, kiăng kơ mơnuih bum dưi thâo ƀuh, laih anŭn mơnuih thâo ƀuh jing hĭ bum mơta.”
And [some] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also? @ Đơđa ƀing Pharisi dŏ giăm Ñu hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, laih anŭn gơñu tơña kơ Yêsu: “Hyư̆m ƀing gơmơi ăt jing mơnuih bum mơ̆n hă?”
Jesus said to them, If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see, your sin remains. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơdah ƀing gih bum mơta, ƀing gih ƀu hmâo tơlơi soh ôh; samơ̆ yua kơ ƀing gih laĭ: ‘Gơmơi ƀuh,’ tui anŭn yơh tơlơi soh ƀing gih ăt dŏ.”
Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, *he* is a thief and a robber; @ “Kâo laĭ sĭt biă mă kơ ƀing gih, hlơi pô ƀu mŭt ôh mơ̆ng bah amăng war triu samơ̆ ñu đĭ mŭt ƀơi jơlan pơkŏn, pô anŭn jing sa čô mơnuih klĕ dŏp. 
but he that enters in by the door is [the] shepherd of the sheep. @ Samơ̆ pô mŭt mơ̆ng bah amăng war triu, ñu anŭn jing pô wai triu. 
To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out. @ Pô gak wai bah amăng či pŏk bah amăng kơ ñu, khul triu hmư̆ asăp ñu, pô wai iâu anăn triu ñu hăng ba tơbiă pơ gah rơngiao. 
When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice. @ Tơ pô wai ba tơbiă abih bang triu pơ gah rơngiao laih, ñu nao hlâo laih anŭn khul triu tui klon, yua kơ khul triu thâo krăn hiăp ñu. 
But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice of strangers. @ Khul triu ƀu đuaĭ tui ƀing mơnuih tuai ôh, kơđai glaĭ, gơñu đuaĭ kơdŏp yua kơ gơñu ƀu thâo krăn hiăp ƀing djuai tuai ôh.”
This allegory spoke Jesus to them, but they did not know what it was [of] which he spoke to them. @ Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi bơhmutu anai kơ gơñu samơ̆ gơñu ƀu thâo hluh ôh hơgĕt tơlơi Yêsu kiăng laĭ kơ gơñu.
Jesus therefore said again to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep. @ Hnŭn yơh Yêsu pơhiăp dơ̆ng kơ gơñu: “Kâo laĭ sĭt biă mă kơ ƀing gih, Kâo jing bah amăng kơ triu. 
All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. @ Abih bang mơnuih rai hlâo kơ Kâo jing ƀing mơnuih klĕ dŏp soh sel, samơ̆ khul triu ƀu hmư̆ gơñu ôh. 
I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture. @ Kâo jing bah amăng. Hlơi pô mŭt mơ̆ng Kâo ñu či dưi klaih, gơñu či mŭt laih anŭn tơbiă, bưp tơdrŏn rơ̆k mơda. 
The thief comes not but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I am come that they might have life, and might have [it] abundantly. @ Pô klĕ dŏp rai kơnơ̆ng kiăng kơ klĕ, pơdjai hăng pơrai hĭ triu. Samơ̆ Kâo hmâo rai laih kiăng kơ triu hmâo tơlơi hơdip, laih anŭn hmâo tơlơi hơdip rơbeh blai.”
I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep: @ “Kâo jing pô wai triu hiam klă. Pô wai triu hiam klă rơngiă tơlơi hơdip Ñu yua kơ khul triu ñu. 
but he who serves for wages, and who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep. @ Pô wai arăng apah ñu ƀu djơ̆ pô wai triu ôh, khul triu ƀu lơ̆m kơ ñu ôh, yua kơ anŭn yơh tơ ñu ƀuh asâo tan rai ñu lui hĭ khul triu hăng đuaĭ kơdŏp. Asâo glai kĕ pơrai hăng pơčơlah hĭ bru bra. 
Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for wages, and is not himself concerned about the sheep. @ Pô wai apah dŏp yua kơ ñu kơnơ̆ng jing pô wai arăng apah, hnŭn yơh ñu ƀu bơngơ̆t kơ khul triu ôh. 
I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine, @ Kâo jing pô wai triu hiam klă. Kâo thâo krăn khul triu Kâo, laih anŭn triu Kâo thâo krăn Kâo, 
as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep. @ kar hăng Ama thâo krăn Kâo, laih anŭn Kâo thâo krăn Ama; Kâo pơsăn lui tơlơi hơdip Kâo yua kơ khul triu. 
And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd. @ Kâo dŏ hmâo khul triu pơkŏn dơ̆ng, gơñu aka dŏ amăng war anai ôh. Kâo ăt khŏm ba gơñu glaĭ mơ̆n. Khul triu anŭn či hmư̆ hiăp Kâo, tui anŭn kơnơ̆ng či hmâo sa khul triu hăng sa čô pô wai đôč.
On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again. @ Ama khăp kơ Kâo, yua kơ Kâo pơsăn lui tơlơi hơdip Kâo, kiăng kơ Kâo dưi mă glaĭ dơ̆ng. 
No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment of my Father. @ Ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi mă lui hĭ tơlơi hơdip Kâo ôh, samơ̆ Kâo pơsăn hĭ Kâo pô tui hăng kâo pô kiăng, Kâo hmâo tơlơi dưi pơsăn lui ñu laih anŭn hmâo tơlơi dưi mă glaĭ. Kâo hmâo mă tŭ tơlơi pơtă anai mơ̆ng Ama Kâo.”
There was a division again among the Jews on account of these words; @ Sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng, yua kơ tơlơi pơhiăp anŭn hmâo tơlơi pơkah tơdruă tơ̆ng krah ƀing ană Yuđa. 
but many of them said, He has a demon and raves; why do ye hear him? @ Lu amăng ƀing ană Yuđa laĭ: “Ñu hmâo yang sat ngă, ñu jing hưt, hyư̆m ƀing gih kiăng dŏ hmư̆ ñu lĕ?”
Others said, These sayings are not [those] of one that is possessed by a demon. Can a demon open blind people's eyes? @ Samơ̆ đơđa ƀing pơkŏn laĭ: “Tơlơi pơhiăp anŭn ƀu djơ̆ mơ̆ng sa čô yang sat ngă ôh. Yang sat dưi pơsuaih sa čô mơnuih bum mơta mơ̆n hă?”
Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem, and it was winter. @ Hlăk anŭn pơ plei Yêrusalem amăng bơyan puih hmâo phĕt pơhơdơr kơ hrơi pơyơr Sang Kơkuh Pơpŭ. 
And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon. @ Yêsu rơbat ngui amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ ƀơi adring Salômôn. 
The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, say [so] to us openly. @ Ƀing Yuđa pơƀŭt jum dar Ñu hăng tơña kơ Ñu: “Hơdôm sui dơ̆ng Ih či lui gơmơi dŏ čang tơguan? Tơdah Ih jing Krist, brơi Ih pơhiăp klă rơđah kơ gơmơi bĕ.”
Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye do not believe. The works which I do in my Father's name, these bear witness concerning me: @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo hmâo laĭ laih kơ ƀing gih, samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu đaŏ ôh. Hơdôm bruă Kâo hmâo ngă amăng anăn Ama Kâo, bruă anŭn ngă gơ̆ng jơlan brơi kơ Kâo. 
but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I told you. @ Samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu đaŏ, yua kơ ƀing gih ƀu djơ̆ khul triu Kâo ôh. 
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me; @ Khul triu Kâo hmư̆ hiăp Kâo, Kâo thâo krăn gơñu, laih anŭn gơñu đuaĭ tui Kâo. 
and I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand. @ Kâo pha brơi kơ gơñu tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar, laih anŭn gơñu ƀu či răm rai hĭ ôh, laih anŭn ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi sua mă gơñu mơ̆ng tơngan Kâo lơi. 
My Father who has given [them] to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father. @ Ama Kâo jing pô hmâo pha brơi laih gơñu kơ Kâo, Ñu jing prŏng hloh kơ abih bang, laih anŭn ƀu hmâo hlơi pô dưi sua mă gơñu mơ̆ng tơngan Ama Kâo ôh. 
I and the Father are one. @ Kâo hăng Ama Kâo jing sa.”
The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him. @ Ƀing ană Yuđa mă boh pơtâo dơ̆ng kiăng glŏm pơdjai Yêsu. 
Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewn you of my Father; for which work of them do ye stone me? @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo hmâo pơrơđah laih kơ ƀing gih lu bruă hiam mơ̆ng Ama. Djơ̆ mơ̆ yua kơ bruă anŭn ƀing gih kiăng glŏm boh pơtâo kơ Kâo?”
The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God. @ Ƀing ană Yuđa laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ bruă hiam ôh gơmơi kiăng glŏm boh pơtâo kơ Ih, samơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi Ih pơhiăp pơgao hmiah hăng Ơi Adai. Ih kơnơ̆ng jing ană mơnuih đôč samơ̆ Ih pơjing pô Ih jing Ơi Adai.”
Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă arăng hmâo čih laih amăng tơlơi juăt ƀing gih: ‘Kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih jing ƀing yang’? 
If he called *them* gods to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken), @ Tơdah tơlơi juăt laĭ ƀing mă tŭ Boh Ơi Adai Pơhiăp jing ƀing yang, (laih anŭn Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih ƀu dưi pơplih ôh), 
do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of God? @ Bơ Kâo, jing pô Ama hmâo pơkah pioh kơ rơgoh hiam hăng pơkiaŏ rai amăng lŏn tơnah. Hyư̆m ƀing gih laĭ Kâo pơhiăp pơgao hmiah hăng Ơi Adai, tơdah Kâo laĭ: ‘Kâo jing Ană Ơi Adai lĕ?’ 
If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not; @ Tơdah kâo ƀu ngă ôh khul bruă Ama Kâo, ƀing gih anăm đaŏ kơ Kâo ôh. 
but if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know [and believe] that the Father is in me and I in him. @ Bơ tơdah Kâo ngă bruă Ama Kâo, wơ̆t dah ƀing gih ƀu đaŏ kơ Kâo tŭ mơ̆n, samơ̆ đaŏ bĕ kơ bruă Kâo hmâo ngă, kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi thâo hăng hluh kơ Ama dŏ amăng Kâo laih anŭn Kâo dŏ amăng Ama.”
They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away from out of their hand @ Gơñu kiăng mă čaŏ Yêsu dơ̆ng, samơ̆ Yêsu klaih hĭ mơ̆ng tơngan gơñu.
and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first: and he abode there. @ Yêsu găn nao pơ hang gah adih ia krong Yurdan dơ̆ng ƀơi anih Yôhan ngă ƀatem blŭng hlâo, laih anŭn Ñu dŏ pơ anŭn. 
And many came to him, and said, John did no sign; but all things which John said of this [man] were true. @ Lu mơnuih nao pơ Yêsu, gơñu laĭ: “Yôhan ƀu hmâo ngă sa mơta tơlơi mơsêh mơyang ôh, samơ̆ abih bang tơlơi Yôhan hmâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ mơnuih anai jing sĭt.” 
And many believed on him there. @ Pơ anŭn hmâo lu mơnuih đaŏ kơ Yêsu.
Now there was a certain [man] sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister. @ Hmâo sa čô mơnuih ruă anăn ñu Lasar, plei Bêthani, jing plei HʼMari hăng amai ñu HʼMart. 
It was [the] Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick. @ HʼMari anŭn yơh jing pô hmâo pik ia klôñ ƀâu hiam ƀơi tơkai Khua Yang laih anŭn sut tơkai Khua Yang hăng ƀuk ñu. Ayŏng ñu Lasar dŏ ruă. 
The sisters therefore sent to him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. @ Tui anŭn dua adơi amai ñu pơkiaŏ mơnuih nao laĭ pơthâo kơ Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Ơ Khua, pô Ih khăp dŏ ruă.”
But when Jesus heard [it], he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it. @ Samơ̆ tơ Yêsu hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, Ñu laĭ: “Tơlơi ruă anai ƀu truh kơ djai ôh, samơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi guh kơang kơ Ơi Adai, kiăng kơ Ană Ơi Adai dưi hmâo tơlơi ư-ang yua kơ tơlơi anŭn.”
Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus. @ Yêsu khăp kơ HʼMart, HʼMari adơi ñu, laih anŭn Lasar. 
When therefore he heard, He is sick, he remained two days then in the place where he was. @ Tơ Ñu hmư̆ Lasar dŏ ruă, Ñu dŏ glaĭ dua hrơi dơ̆ng pơ anih Ñu hlăk dŏ anŭn. 
Then after this he says to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea again. @ Giơ̆ng rơgao hĭ dua hrơi anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu: “Brơi ƀing ta wơ̆t glaĭ pơ tring Yuđa dơ̆ng.”
The disciples say to him, Rabbi, [even but] now the Jews sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither again? @ Ƀing ding kơna Ñu laĭ: “Ơ Nai, ƀing ană Yuđa phrâo kiăng glŏm Ih hăng boh pơtâo, hyư̆m Ih kiăng wơ̆t glaĭ pơ anŭn dơ̆ng lĕ?”
Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walk in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world; @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă hmâo pluh dua mông amăng sa hrơi? Tơdah hlơi pô rơbat hlăk tơhrơi ñu ƀu tơhnač ôh, yua kơ ñu ƀuh tơlơi bơngač lŏn tơnah anai. 
but if any one walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him. @ Samơ̆ tơdah ñu rơbat amăng mlam, ñu či tơhnač, yua kơ tơlơi bơngač ƀu dŏ amăng ñu ôh.” 
These things said he; and after this he says to them, Lazarus, our friend, is fallen asleep, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep. @ Giơ̆ng Yêsu pơhiăp tui anŭn, Ñu laĭ dơ̆ng kơ ƀing gơ̆: “Lasar giăng mah ƀing ta pĭt yơh, samơ̆ Kâo nao kiăng râo mơdưh ñu.”
The disciples therefore said to him, Lord, if he be fallen asleep, he will get well. @ Ƀing ding kơna laĭ: “Ơ Khua, tơdah ñu pĭt, sĭt ñu či suaih yơh.”
But Jesus spoke of his death, but *they* thought that he spoke of the rest of sleep. @ Yêsu pơhiăp kơ tơlơi gơ̆ djai yơh, samơ̆ gơñu pơmĭn Yêsu pơhiăp kơ tơlơi pĭt pơdơi đôč. 
Jesus therefore then said to them plainly, Lazarus has died. @ Tui anŭn Yêsu pơhiăp klă rơđah kơ gơñu: “Lasar djai yơh; 
And I rejoice on your account that I was not there, in order that ye may believe. But let us go to him. @ samơ̆ yua kơ ƀing gih yơh Kâo mơak yua kơ Kâo ƀu dŏ pơ anŭn ôh, kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi đaŏ. Brơi ƀing ta nao pơ ñu bĕ.”
Thomas therefore, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let *us* also go, that we may die with him. @ Thômas, anăn pơkŏn dơ̆ng Didim, laĭ kơ ƀing ding kơna pơkŏn: “Brơi kơ ƀing ta nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu bĕ kiăng kơ ƀing ta dưi djai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu mơ̆n.”
Jesus therefore [on] arriving found him to have been four days already in the tomb. @ Tơ Yêsu truh, Ñu thâo kơ Lasar dŏ amăng pơsat pă hrơi laih. 
Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen stadia off, @ Plei Bêthani ataih mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem, năng ai klâo kilômet. 
and many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, that they might console them concerning their brother. @ Hmâo lu ƀing ană Yuđa nao pơ HʼMart hăng HʼMari kiăng pơalum ƀing gơ̆ yua kơ ayŏng gơñu djai.
Martha then, when she heard Jesus is coming, went to meet him; but Mary sat in the house. @ Tơ HʼMart hmư̆ Yêsu rai, gơ̆ đuaĭ nao bưp Ñu tơdang HʼMari dŏ pơ sang. 
Martha therefore said to Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died; @ HʼMart laĭ kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Khua, tơdah hmâo Ih pơ anai ayŏng kâo ƀu djai ôh. 
but even now I know, that whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee. @ Samơ̆ wơ̆t ră anai kâo thâo hơgĕt tơlơi Ih rơkâo kơ Ơi Adai, Ơi Adai či brơi kơ Ih.” 
Jesus says to her, Thy brother shall rise again. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Ayŏng ih či hơdip glaĭ.”
Martha says to him, I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day. @ HʼMart laĭ kơ Ñu: “Kâo thâo kơ gơ̆ či hơdip glaĭ amăng tơlơi hơdip glaĭ ƀơi hrơi đŭt tơdơi.”
Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believes on me, though he have died, shall live; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơ̆: “Kâo jing tơlơi hơdip glaĭ laih anŭn tơlơi hơdip. Hlơi pô đaŏ kơ Kâo, ñu či hơdip, wơ̆t dah ñu djai laih; 
and every one who lives and believes on me shall never die. Believest thou this? @ Laih anŭn hlơi pô dŏ hơdip đaŏ kơ Kâo, ñu ƀu či djai ôh. Ih đaŏ tơlơi anŭn mơ̆?”
She says to him, Yea, Lord; I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world. @ HʼMart laĭ glaĭ: “Sĭt, Ơ Khua, kâo đaŏ Ih jing Yang Krist, Ană Ơi Adai, Pô khŏm rai amăng lŏn tơnah.”
And having said this, she went away and called her sister Mary secretly, saying, The teacher is come and calls thee. @ Giơ̆ng kơ HʼMart laĭ tơlơi anai, gơ̆ nao iâu HʼMari adơi ñu, hăng hiăp pơhač: “Nai rai pơ anai yơh, Ñu iâu ih.” 
She, when she heard [that], rises up quickly and comes to him. @ Tơ HʼMari hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơ̆ tơgŭ mơtam hăng nao pơ Yêsu. 
Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha came to meet him. @ Hlăk anŭn Yêsu aka mŭt amăng plei ôh, samơ̆ Ñu ăt dŏ ƀơi anih HʼMart hmâo bưp Ñu. 
The Jews therefore who were with her in the house and consoling her, seeing Mary that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, She goes to the tomb, that she may weep there. @ Tơ ƀing ană Yuđa amăng sang dŏ pơalum HʼMari ƀuh gơ̆ ječ meč hăng tơbiă nao, gơñu đuaĭ tui gơ̆, mĭn dah gơ̆ nao čŏk hia pơ pơsat.
Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying to him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. @ Tơ HʼMari truh pơ anih Yêsu dŏ laih anŭn ƀuh Ñu, HʼMari glŏm ñu pô ƀơi tơkai Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Ơ Khua, tơdah hmâo Ih pơ anai, ayŏng kâo ƀu djai ôh.”
Jesus therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, was deeply moved in spirit, and was troubled, @ Yêsu ƀuh HʼMari hia, laih anŭn ƀing ană Yuđa rai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng HʼMari ăt hia kar kaĭ mơ̆n, Ñu rơngot hơning hăng glưh pran jua.

Ƀing anŭn laĭ glaĭ kơ Ñu: “Ơ Khua, rai lăng bĕ.”
Jesus wept. @ Yêsu hia. 
The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him! @ Tui anŭn ƀing ană Yuđa laĭ: “Lăng bĕ, Ñu khăp biă mă kơ Lasar!”
And some of them said, Could not this [man], who has opened the eyes of the blind [man], have caused that this [man] also should not have died? @ Samơ̆ hmâo đơđa amăng ƀing gơñu laĭ: “Pô anai hmâo pơsuaih laih mơnuih bum mơta, hyư̆m Ñu ƀu dưi ôh hă ngă brơi pô anai ƀu djai?”
Jesus therefore, again deeply moved in himself, comes to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. @ Sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng Yêsu glưh pran jua hăng nao pơ pơsat. Pơsat anŭn jing sa boh par, hmâo boh pơtâo kơđơ̆l hĭ. 
Jesus says, Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of the dead, says to him, Lord, he stinks already, for he is four days [there]. @ Yêsu pơđar: “Tơglung lui hĭ bĕ boh pơtâo anai.”
HʼMart jing adơi kơ pô djai anŭn laĭ: “Ơ Khua, ƀâu brŭ laih yơh, yua kơ ñu dŏ pơ anai pă hrơi laih.”
Jesus says to her, Did I not say to thee, that if thou shouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ HʼMart: “Hyư̆m kâo aka laĭ hăng ih ôh hă, tơdah ih đaŏ ih či ƀuh tơlơi guh kơang Ơi Adai?” 
They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifted up his eyes on high and said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me; @ Tui anŭn gơñu tơglung hĭ boh pơtâo anŭn. Yêsu angak mơta hăng laĭ: “Ơ Ama, kâo bơni hơơč kơ Ih yua kơ Ih hmâo hmư̆ laih Kâo. 
but I knew that thou always hearest me; but on account of the crowd who stand around I have said [it], that they may believe that thou hast sent me. @ Kâo thâo Ih hmư̆ Kâo nanao, samơ̆ Kâo laĭ tơlơi anai yua kơ ƀing mơnuih dŏ jum dar anai, kiăng kơ gơñu dưi đaŏ kơ Ih Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo laih.” 
And having said this, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth. @ Giơ̆ng Yêsu pơhiăp tui anŭn, Ñu iâu kraih tui anai: “Ơ Lasar, tơbiă bĕ!” 
And the dead came forth, bound feet and hands with graveclothes, and his face was bound round with a handkerchief. Jesus says to them, Loose him and let him go. @ Mơnuih djai tơbiă rai yơh, tơkai tơngan gơ̆ arăng pŏn hăng khăn, ƀô̆ Ñu arăng gom hăng sa blah khăn. Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Yaih brơi ñu bĕ, hăng brơi gơ̆ rơbat.”
Many therefore of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done, believed on him; @ Hmâo lu ƀing ană Yuđa nao ngui pơalum HʼMari, hmâo ƀuh laih bruă Yêsu ngă, gơñu đaŏ kơ Yêsu. 
but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. @ Samơ̆ đơđa amăng ƀing anŭn nao pơ ƀing Pharisi hăng ră ruai brơi gơñu hơdôm tơlơi Yêsu hmâo ngă laih. 
The chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man does many signs. @ Tui anŭn, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing Pharisi iâu pơƀŭt ƀing khua phat kơđi hăng laĭ: “Hơgĕt ƀing ta či ngă? Yua kơ pô anai ngă lu tơlơi mơsêh mơyang biă mă. 
If we let him thus alone, all will believe on him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation. @ Tơdah ƀing ta lui Ñu ăt ngă dơ̆ng, tui anŭn abih bang mơnuih či đaŏ kơ Ñu, laih anŭn ƀing Rôm či rai pơrai hĭ anih rơgoh hiam ƀing ta hăng pơdjai hĭ kơnŭng djuai ƀing ta.”
But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, Ye know nothing @ Samơ̆ sa čô amăng ƀing gơñu, anăn ñu Kaip jing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh thŭn anŭn, laĭ kơ gơñu: “Ƀing gih ƀu thâo hluh sa mơta tơlơi ôh. 
nor consider that it is profitable for you that one man die for the people, and not that the whole nation perish. @ Ƀing gih ƀu thâo hluh ôh hă hiam hloh kơ ƀing gih hmâo sa čô mơnuih djai yua kơ abih bang ƀing ană plei hloh kơ abih bang kơnŭng djuai či răm rai.” 
But this he did not say of himself; but, being high priest that year, prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation; @ Ñu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn ƀu djơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi pơmĭn ñu pô ôh, samơ̆ yua kơ ñu jing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh thŭn anŭn, ñu laĭ lui hlâo kơ Yêsu či djai yua kơ abih bang kơnŭng djuai ană Yuđa, 
and not for the nation only, but that he should also gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad. @ ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng kơ kơnŭng djuai ană Yuđa đôč ôh, samơ̆ ăt kiăng pơƀŭt glaĭ abih bang ƀing ană Ơi Adai hlăk bra hyu tar ƀar jing hĭ sa phung.
From that day therefore they took counsel that they might kill him. @ Mơ̆ng hrơi anŭn ƀing khua ngă yang črŏng sai hơduah jơlan kiăng pơdjai Yêsu. 
Jesus therefore walked no longer openly among the Jews, but went away thence into the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there he sojourned with the disciples. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh, Yêsu ƀu dưi hyu hăng tơlơi rơngai dơ̆ng ôh tơ̆ng krah ƀing ană Yuđa, samơ̆ mơ̆ng anih anŭn Ñu nao pơ plei Êphraim jĕ tơdrŏn tač; laih anŭn Ñu dŏ pơ anŭn hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu.
But the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves. @ Hrơi Phĕt Tơlơi Găn ƀing ană Yuđa jĕ truh, laih anŭn hmâo lu mơnuih mơ̆ng tring phara nao pơ plei Yêrusalem kiăng pơrơgoh gơñu pô hlâo kơ Hrơi phĕt Tơlơi Găn. 
They sought therefore Jesus, and said among themselves, standing in the temple, What do ye think? that he will not come to the feast? @ Gơñu hơduah sem Yêsu, laih anŭn tơdang gơñu dŏ dơ̆ng amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, gơñu bơlaĭ tơdruă: “Hyư̆m ƀing gih pơmĭn? Yêsu ƀu či rai ôh hă kơ tơlơi phĕt anai?” 
Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment that if any one knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might take him. @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing Pharisi hmâo pơtă laih hlơi pô thâo anih Yêsu dŏ, brơi pô anŭn laĭ brơi kơ gơñu thâo, kiăng kơ gơñu dưi mă čaŏ Yêsu.
Jesus therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was the dead [man] Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from among [the] dead. @ Năm hrơi hlâo kơ phĕt Tơlơi Găn, Yêsu nao pơ Bêthani jing plei Lasar, pô Yêsu hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng tơlơi djai. 
There therefore they made him a supper, and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those at table with him. @ Pơ anŭn arăng pơkra mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă jum Yêsu. HʼMart buih bruă pŭ mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă, laih anŭn Lasar jing sa čô amăng ƀing dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu. 
Mary therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of pure nard of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair, and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. @ Hlăk anŭn HʼMari mă sa mơkrah lit ia klôñ ngă hăng kơyâo nard sĭt, yom biă mă, pik tơkai Yêsu laih anŭn sut hăng ƀuk gơ̆, amăng sang bă hăng mơnâo ƀâu hiam. 
One of his disciples therefore, Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote, who was about to deliver him up, says, @ Samơ̆ Yudas Iskariôt jing sa čô amăng ƀing ding kơna Yêsu (pô tơdơi anai či pơblư̆ lui Yêsu), ñu laĭ, 
Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor? @ “Hyư̆m ƀu sĭ hĭ ia klôñ ƀâu hiam anŭn hăng nua klâo rơtuh đơniê laih anŭn pha brơi kơ ƀing mơnuih ƀun rin?” 
But he said this, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag, and carried what was put into [it]. @ Ñu laĭ tui anŭn ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ ñu bơngơ̆t kơ ƀing mơnuih ƀun rin ôh, samơ̆ yua kơ ñu jing mơnuih klĕ dŏp. Ñu jing pô djă kơdŭng prăk, hăng juăt kơđeo mă prăk arăng pioh amăng kơdŭng anŭn.
Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to have kept this for the day of my preparation for burial; @ Samơ̆ Yêsu laĭ: “Lui măk ai gơ̆ bĕ, ñu hmâo pioh ia klôñ ƀâu hiam anai kơ hrơi dơr kâo. 
for ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always. @ Ƀing gih dŏ hmâo mơnuih ƀun rin hrŏm hăng ƀing gih nanao, samơ̆ ƀing gih ƀu hmâo kâo nanao ôh.”
A great crowd therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not because of Jesus only, but also that they might see Lazarus whom he raised from among [the] dead. @ Sa phung lu ƀing ană Yuđa hmâo hmư̆ Yêsu pơ Bêthani, anŭn yơh gơñu rai, ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng yua kơ Yêsu pơ anŭn đôč ôh samơ̆ ăt kiăng lăng Lasar mơ̆n, pô Yêsu hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ laih mơ̆ng tơlơi djai. 
But the chief priests took counsel that they might kill Lazarus also, @ Tui anŭn ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng črŏng sai kiăng pơdjai wơ̆t hăng Lasar mơ̆n. 
because many of the Jews went away on his account and believed on Jesus. @ Yua kơ mơ̆ng Lasar yơh hmâo lu ƀing ană Yuđa čơlah mơ̆ng gơñu hăng đaŏ kơ Yêsu.
On the morrow a great crowd who came to the feast, having heard that Jesus is coming into Jerusalem, @ Hrơi tơdơi kơ anŭn, hmâo sa phung lu rai kơ hrơi phĕt hmư̆ Yêsu hlăk rai pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
took branches of palms and went out to meet him, and cried, Hosanna, blessed [is] he that comes in the name of [the] Lord, the King of Israel. @ Tui anŭn gơñu mă than gol hăng nao drông Yêsu, hăng ur dreo: “Hôsana, mơyun hiam kơ pô rai amăng anăn Khua Yang, jing Pơtao ƀing Israel!”
And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat upon it; as it is written, @ Yêsu ƀuh sa drơi ană aseh kle, Ñu đĭ ƀơi gơ̆, tui hăng Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih:
Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. @ “Anăm hwĭ ôh! Ơ ană dra plei Siôn;
Anai nê, pơtao ih rai, đĭ ƀơi ană aseh kle.”
[Now] his disciples knew not these things at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him. @ Hlăk anŭn ƀing ding kơna Ñu ƀu thâo hluh ôh kơ tơlơi anŭn; samơ̆ tơ Ơi Adai pơ-ư pơang laih Yêsu, hlăk anŭn gơñu hơdơr kơ Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih tơlơi anŭn djơ̆ kơ Ñu, hăng hmâo ngă laih kơ Ñu tui anŭn.
The crowd therefore that was with him bore witness because he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from among [the] dead. @ Phung mơnuih lu hmâo dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu hlăk Ñu iâu Lasar tơbiă mơ̆ng pơsat hăng pơhơdip glaĭ gơ̆ mơ̆ng tơlơi djai, leng ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ tơlơi hmâo truh laih. 
Therefore also the crowd met him because they had heard that he had done this sign. @ Phung mơnuih lu nao drông Yêsu, yua kơ gơñu hmâo hmư̆ Yêsu ngă tơlơi mơsêh mơyang anŭn. 
The Pharisees therefore said to one another, Ye see that ye profit nothing: behold, the world is gone after him. @ Hnŭn yơh ƀing Pharisi bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu: “Lăng adih, ƀing ta ƀu dưi ngă hơgĕt ôh. Lăng bĕ, abih lŏn tơnah hmâo đuaĭ tui Ñu soh sel.”
And there were certain Greeks among those who came up that they might worship in the feast; @ Amăng ƀing mơnuih nao kơkuh pơpŭ amăng hrơi phĕt tơlơi găn hmâo đơđa ƀing Grek. 
these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked him saying, Sir, we desire to see Jesus. @ Gơñu nao pơ Philip plei Bêtsaida amăng tring Galilê, hăng laĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ khua, gơmơi kiăng bưp Yêsu.”
Philip comes and tells Andrew, [and again] Andrew comes and Philip, and they tell Jesus. @ Philip nao laĭ kơ Andrê, laih anŭn Andrê nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Philip nao laĭ kơ Yêsu. 
But Jesus answered them saying, The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Mông Ană Mơnuih mă tŭ tơlơi ư-ang truh yơh. 
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat falling into the ground die, it abides alone; but if it die, it bears much fruit. @ Kâo laĭ sĭt biă mă kơ ƀing gih tơdah sa asar pơdai ƀu lĕ pơ lŏn hăng djai hĭ, ñu ăt dŏ kơnơ̆ng sa sar đôč; samơ̆ tơdah ñu djai hĭ, ñu či mơboh lu.

If any one serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be *my* servant. [And] if any one serve me, him shall the Father honour. @ Hlơi pô mă bruă Kâo, ñu khŏm đuaĭ tui Kâo. Pơpă anih Kâo dŏ, ding kơna Kâo ăt dŏ pơ anŭn mơ̆n. Hlơi pô mă bruă Kâo, Ama kâo či pơpŭ pơyom kơ ñu.”
Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But on account of this have I come to this hour. @ “Ră anai bơngăt jua Kâo rŭng răng biă mă. Hơgĕt Kâo či laĭ: ‘Ơ Ama, pơklaih Kâo mơ̆ng mông anai?’ Ơ ơh, samơ̆ yua kơ mông anai yơh Kâo hmâo rai laih. 
Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, I both have glorified and will glorify [it] again. @ Ơ Ama, brơi tơlơi ư-ang kơ anăn Ih bĕ.” Hlăk anŭn hmâo asăp pơhiăp mơ̆ng adai: “Kâo hmâo ư-ang laih kơ anăn Kâo, laih anŭn Kâo či pơ-ư ang anăn Kâo dơ̆ng.” 
The crowd therefore, which stood [there] and heard [it], said that it had thundered. Others said, An angel has spoken to him. @ Phung mơnuih lu dŏ jĕ hmư̆ jua hiăp anŭn laĭ: “Anŭn jing dơnai grơ̆m.” Ƀing pơkŏn laĭ: “Sa čô ling jang adai pơhiăp hăng Ñu.” 
Jesus answered and said, Not on my account has this voice come, but on yours. @ Yêsu laĭ: “Asăp anai hmâo truh yua kơ ƀing gih, ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ Kâo ôh. 
Now is [the] judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out: @ Ră anai tơlơi phat kơđi truh laih kơ lŏn tơnah, laih anŭn Ơi Adai či pơglưh hĭ khua wai lăng lŏn tơnah anai. 
and I, if I be lifted up out of the earth, will draw all to me. @ Bơ Kâo, tơ arăng yol đĭ drơi jan Kâo mơ̆ng lŏn, Kâo či dui ba abih bang mơnuih rai pơ Kâo.” 
But this he said signifying by what death he was about to die. @ Ñu laĭ tơlơi anŭn kiăng pơrơđah hyư̆m Ñu či djai.
The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who *is* this, the Son of man? @ Phung mơnuih lu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gơmơi hmâo hmư̆ laih amăng hră tơlơi juăt laĭ kơ Yang Krist dŏ hlŏng lar. Hyư̆m Ih dưi laĭ arăng khŏm yol đĭ Ană Mơnuih pơ glong lĕ? Hlơi Ană Mơnuih anŭn?”
Jesus therefore said to them, Yet a little while is the light amongst you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness may not overtake you. And he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơlơi bơngač dŏ hrŏm hăng ƀing gih ƀu sui dơ̆ng ôh. Rơbat nao bĕ tơdang ƀing gih dŏ hmâo tơlơi bơngač, hwĭ kơ tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt plŭt gom hĭ ƀing gih. Hlơi pô rơbat amăng tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt ñu ƀu thâo ôh pơpă anih ñu nao. 
While ye have the light, believe in the light, that ye may become sons of light. Jesus said these things, and going away hid himself from them. @ Tơdang gih dŏ hmâo tơlơi bơngač, đaŏ bĕ kơ tơlơi bơngač anŭn, kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi jing ƀing ană kơ tơlơi bơngač.”
Giơ̆ng Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, Ñu đuaĭ kơdŏp mơ̆ng ƀing gơñu. 
But though he had done so many signs before them, they believed not on him, @ Wơ̆t dah Ñu hmâo ngă laih lu tơlơi mơsêh mơyang ƀơi anăp gơñu, gơñu ăt kŏn đaŏ kơ Ñu lơi. 
that the word of the prophet Esaias which he said might be fulfilled, Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? @ Tơlơi anŭn kiăng pơsĭt tơlơi pô laĭ lui hlâo Êsai hmâo pơhiăp laih:

On this account they could not believe, because Esaias said again, @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh, gơñu ƀu dưi đaŏ ôh, yua kơ Êsai hmâo laĭ dơ̆ng mơ̆n,
He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they may not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal them. @ “Ơi Adai pơbum hĭ mơta gơñu,

These things said Esaias because he saw his glory and spoke of him. @ Êsai pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn yua ñu ƀuh tơlơi ang yang Yang Krist, laih anŭn pơhiăp djơ̆ kơ Ñu.
Although indeed from among the rulers also many believed on him, but on account of the Pharisees did not confess [him], that they might not be put out of the synagogue: @ Wơ̆t dah tui anŭn ăt hmâo lu mơnuih amăng ƀing khua đaŏ kơ Yêsu, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu khĭn pơhaih tơlơi anŭn ôh, yua kơ gơñu hwĭ ƀing Pharisi puh pơđuaĭ gơñu mơ̆ng sang bơjơnum. 
for they loved glory from men rather than glory from God. @ Yua kơ gơñu khăp kơ tơlơi ư-ang mơ̆ng ană mơnuih hloh kơ tơlơi ư-ang mơ̆ng Ơi Adai.
But Jesus cried and said, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that sent me; @ Yêsu pơhiăp kraih: “Hlơi pô đaŏ kơ Kâo, ƀu djơ̆ ñu kơnơ̆ng đaŏ kơ Kâo đôč ôh, samơ̆ đaŏ kơ Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
and he that beholds me, beholds him that sent me. @ Bơ hlơi pô ƀuh Kâo, ñu ăt ƀuh Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo mơ̆n. 
I am come into the world [as] light, that every one that believes on me may not abide in darkness; @ Kâo jing tơlơi bơngač hmâo rai laih amăng lŏn tơnah, kiăng kơ hlơi pô đaŏ kơ Kâo ñu ƀu dŏ amăng tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt dơ̆ng ôh. 
and if any one hear my words and do not keep [them], I judge him not, for I am not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world. @ Tơdah hlơi pô hmư̆ boh pơhiăp Kâo laih anŭn ƀu gưt tui ôh, Kâo ƀu phat kơđi kơ ñu ôh; yua kơ Kâo rai ƀu djơ̆ kiăng kơ phat kơđi kơ lŏn tơnah ôh, samơ̆ kiăng pơklaih lŏn tơnah. 
He that rejects me and does not receive my words, has him who judges him: the word which I have spoken, that shall judge him in the last day. @ Hlơi pô hơngah Kâo laih anŭn ƀu mă tŭ ôh boh pơhiăp Kâo, hmâo laih sa čô phat kơđi kơ ñu; boh pơhiăp Kâo hmâo pơhiăp anŭn yơh či phat kơđi kơ ñu ƀơi hrơi đŭt tơdơi. 
For I have not spoken from myself, but the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what I should say and what I should speak; @ Yua kơ kâo ƀu pơhiăp hăng tơlơi dưi Kâo pô ôh; samơ̆ Ama, Pô hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo, pơđar Kâo pơhiăp tơlơi hơgĕt Kâo khŏm pơhiăp laih anŭn hơgĕt tơlơi Kâo khŏm pơhaih. 
and I know that his commandment is life eternal. What therefore I speak, as the Father has said to me, so I speak. @ Kâo thâo tơlơi Ñu pơđar anŭn jing tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar. Yua kơ anŭn yơh hơgĕt tơlơi Kâo pơhiăp, Kâo pơhiăp tui hăng Ama hmâo pơđar laih kơ Kâo.”
Now before the feast of the passover, Jesus, knowing that his hour had come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, loved them to the end. @ Hlâo kơ phĕt Tơlơi Găn, Yêsu thâo mông Ñu khŏm lui lŏn tơnah kiăng kơ glaĭ pơ Ama truh laih.

And during supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote, that he should deliver him up, @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ ƀơ̆ng huă mlam, yang sat hmâo dưm laih amăng pran jua Yudas Iskariôt, ană đah rơkơi Simôn tơlơi pơmĭn pơblư̆ kơ Yêsu. 
[Jesus,] knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came out from God and was going to God, @ Yêsu thâo Ama hmâo jao laih abih bang mơnơ̆ng amăng tơngan Ñu, Ñu thâo Ñu hmâo rai mơ̆ng Ơi Adai laih anŭn Ñu či glaĭ pơ Ơi Adai. 
rises from supper and lays aside his garments, and having taken a linen towel he girded himself: @ Tui anŭn, Ñu tơgŭ mơ̆ng kơƀang ƀơ̆ng huă, toh hĭ ao phyung Ñu, mă khăn hăng hruă ƀơi kơiăng Ñu. 
then he pours water into the washhand basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the linen towel with which he was girded. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, Ñu tuh ia amăng thao laih anŭn čơdơ̆ng rao tơkai ƀing ding kơna Ñu, Ñu sut tơkai ƀing gơ̆ hăng khăn Ñu pŏn kơiăng. 
He comes therefore to Simon Peter; and *he* says to him, Lord, dost thou wash *my* feet? @ Ñu nao pơ Simôn Pêtrôs, samơ̆ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Ơ Khua, Ih či rao tơkai kâo hă?”
Jesus answered and said to him, What I do thou dost not know now, but thou shalt know hereafter. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Hơgĕt Kâo ngă ih ƀu thâo hluh ôh ră anai, samơ̆ tơdơi ih či thâo hluh.”
Peter says to him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, Unless I wash thee, thou hast not part with me. @ Pêtrôs laĭ: “Ơ ơh, Ih ƀu či rao tơkai kâo ôh!”
Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơdah kâo ƀu rao tơkai ih, ih ƀu dưi jing ding kơna Kâo dơ̆ng ôh.”
Simon Peter says to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head. @ Simôn Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua, anăm kơnơ̆ng rao tơkai Kâo đôč ôh, samơ̆ rao wơ̆t tơngan hăng akŏ kâo mơ̆n!”
Jesus says to him, He that is washed all over needs not to wash save his feet, but is wholly clean; and ye are clean, but not all. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Hlơi mơnơi laih, kơnơ̆ng rao tơkai ñu đôč, dưi rơgoh abih yơh. Ƀing gih hmâo rơgoh laih, samơ̆ ƀu djơ̆ abih bang ƀing gih ôh.” 
For he knew him that delivered him up: on account of this he said, Ye are not all clean. @ Yua kơ Ñu thâo laih hlơi pô či pơblư̆ lui Ñu, yua anŭn yơh Yêsu laĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ abih bang ƀing gih jing rơgoh soh sel ôh.”
When therefore he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, having sat down again, he said to them, Do ye know what I have done to you? @ Giơ̆ng kơ Yêsu rao tơkai ƀing gơ̆, Ñu buh glaĭ ao phyung Ñu, hăng dŏ ber ƀơi kơƀang ƀơ̆ng huă.

Jesus answers, He it is to whom I, after I have dipped the morsel, give it. And having dipped the morsel, he gives it to Judas [son] of Simon, Iscariote. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Anŭn jing pô Kâo či brơi ƀañ tơpŭng Kâo či añrŭ anai”.

He demanded of them therefore again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazaraean. @ Yêsu tơña dơ̆ng: “Hlơi gih sem?” Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Yêsu, Plei Nasaret.”
Jesus answered, I told you that I am [he]: if therefore ye seek me, let these go away; @ Yêsu laĭ: “Kâo laĭ laih kơ ƀing gih, Kâo yơh Yêsu. Tui anŭn tơdah ƀing gih sem Kâo, brơi bĕ ƀing anai đuaĭ.” 
that the word might be fulfilled which he spoke, [As to] those whom thou hast given me, I have not lost one of them. @ Tơlơi anŭn kiăng kơ krĕp djơ̆ tơlơi Ñu hmâo pơhiăp laih: “Kâo ƀu pơrơngiă ôh sa čô amăng ƀing mơnuih Ih hmâo brơi laih kơ Kâo.” 
Simon Peter therefore, having a sword, drew it, and smote the bondman of the high priest and cut off his right ear; and the bondman's name was Malchus. @ Hlăk anŭn Simôn Pêtrôs hmâo sa ƀĕ đao, suă hăng koh ding kơna khua ngă yang prŏng hloh, djơ̆ ƀơi tơngia gah hơnuă hăng tơĭ hĭ. Anăn ding kơna anŭn Malkus. 
Jesus therefore said to Peter, Put the sword into the sheath; the cup which the Father has given me, shall I not drink it? @ Yêsu laĭ kơ Pêtrôs: “Jek glaĭ bĕ đao ih amăng hrŭm ñu. Kơčok Ama hmâo brơi laih kơ Kâo, hyư̆m Kâo ƀu mơñum ôh hă?”
The band therefore, and the chiliarch, and the officers of the Jews, took Jesus and bound him: @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ƀing tơhan Rôm, khua tơhan hăng ƀing tơhan ană Yuđa mă čaŏ Yêsu. 
and they led him away to Annas first; for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. @ Hlâo hloh gơñu ba nao Yêsu pơ Anas; yua kơ Anas jing tơhmua kơ Kaip. Kaip jing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh ƀơi thŭn anŭn. 
But it was Caiaphas who counselled the Jews that it was better that one man should perish for the people. @ Kaip anŭn mơ̆n hmâo pơtô brơi laih kơ ƀing ană Yuđa: sa čô mơnuih djai pơala kơ ană plei pla jing hiam hloh.
Now Simon Peter followed Jesus, and the other disciple. But that disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest; @ Simôn Pêtrôs hăng sa čô ding kơna pơkŏn đuaĭ tui Yêsu. Yua kơ khua ngă yang prŏng hloh thâo krăn ding kơna anŭn, ñu mŭt amăng wăl sang khua ngă yang prŏng hloh hrŏm hăng Yêsu. 
but Peter stood at the door without. The other disciple therefore, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the porteress and brought in Peter. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs ăt dŏ dơ̆ng pơ gah rơngiao ƀơi bah amăng. Hnŭn yơh pô ding kơna pơkŏn anŭn jing pô khua ngă yang prŏng hloh thâo krăn, tơbiă nao pơhiăp hăng sa čô đah kơmơi gak wai bah amăng, hăng ba Pêtrôs mŭt. 
The maid therefore, who was porteress, says to Peter, Art thou also of the disciples of this man? He says, I am not. @ Đah kơmơi gak wai bah amăng anŭn laĭ kơ Pêtrôs: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă ih ăt jing sa čô amăng ƀing ding kơna kơ pô anŭn?”
Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ƀu djơ̆ ôh.”
But the bondmen and officers, having made a fire of coals (for it was cold), stood and warmed themselves; and Peter was standing with them and warming himself. @ Yua kơ mlam anŭn rơŏt tui anŭn ƀing ding kơna hăng ƀing khua tơhan rơ̆m apui, laih anŭn gơñu mơdang. Pêtrôs ăt dŏ mơdang apui hrŏm hăng gơñu mơ̆n.
The high priest therefore demanded of Jesus concerning his disciples and concerning his doctrine. @ Khua ngă yang prŏng hloh tơña kơ Yêsu tơlơi djơ̆ kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu laih anŭn kơ tơlơi Ñu pơtô. 
Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I taught always in [the] synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews come together, and in secret I have spoken nothing. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo hmâo pơhiăp rơđah laih ƀơi anăp abih bang mơnuih, Kâo pơtô nanao amăng sang bơjơnum hăng amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, anih abih bang ƀing ană Yuđa juăt bơjơnum. Kâo ƀu hmâo pơhiăp sa mơta hăng tơlơi hơgơ̆m ôh. 
Why demandest thou of me? Demand of those who have heard, what I have spoken to them; behold, they know what I have said. @ Hyư̆m ih tơña kơ Kâo? Tơña bĕ ƀing hmâo hmư̆ laih hơgĕt tơlơi Kâo hmâo pơhiăp laih hăng gơñu. Ƀing anŭn thâo laih hơdôm tơlơi Kâo hmâo pơhiăp.”
But as he said these things, one of the officers who stood by gave a blow on the face to Jesus, saying, Answerest thou the high priest thus? @ Tơdang Yêsu pơhiăp laih tơlơi anŭn, sa čô amăng ƀing tơhan dŏ wai pơ anŭn pah meng Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Hyư̆m Ih khĭn laĭ glaĭ hăng khua ngă yang prŏng hloh tui anŭn?”
Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me? @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơdah Kâo pơhiăp soh, laĭ brơi kơ Kâo thâo tơlơi ƀu djơ̆ anŭn bĕ, samơ̆ tơdah Kâo pơhiăp djơ̆ yua hơgĕt ih pah meng Kâo lĕ?”
Annas [then] had sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest. @ Anas pơđar arăng ba Yêsu nao pơ Kaip khua ngă yang prŏng hloh, hlăk anŭn tơngan Yêsu arăng ăt dŏ čaŏ.
But Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said therefore to him, Art thou also of his disciples? He denied, and said, I am not. @ Hlăk anŭn Simôn Pêtrôs dŏ dơ̆ng mơdang apui, hmâo pô pơkŏn tơña kơ ñu: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă ih ăt jing sa čô amăng ƀing ding kơna Ñu?”
Pêtrôs hơngah hăng laĭ: “Ư ưh ƀu djơ̆ kâo ôh.”
One of the bondmen of the high priest, who was kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? @ Hmâo sa čô amăng ƀing hlŭn khua ngă yang prŏng hloh jing kơnŭng djuai pô Pêtrôs hmâo koh tơĭ tơngia, laih anŭn tơña: “Ƀu djơ̆ ih ôh hă kâo hmâo ƀuh amăng đang hrŏm hăng Ñu?”
Peter denied therefore again, and immediately [the] cock crew. @ Sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng Pêtrôs hơngah; laih anŭn mơnŭ tơdjô̆ mơtam.
They lead therefore Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium; and it was early morn. And *they* entered not into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but eat the passover. @ Ưm mơguah ƀing gơñu ba nao Yêsu mơ̆ng sang Kaip truh pơ sang khua čar. Gơñu pô ƀu mŭt ôh amăng sang khua čar, kiăng klaih kơ tơlơi hơƀak drak laih anŭn dưi ƀơ̆ng phĕt Tơlơi Găn. 
Pilate therefore went out to them and said, What accusation do ye bring against this man? @ Tui anŭn yơh Pilat tơbiă nao pơ ƀing gơñu hăng laĭ: “Yua kơ tơlơi hơgĕt ƀing gih phong kơ pô anai?”
They answered and said to him, If this [man] were not an evildoer, we should not have delivered him up to thee. @ Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơdah pô anai ƀu jing mơnuih soh sat ôh, gơmơi ƀu jao ñu kơ ih ôh.”
Pilate therefore said to them, Take him, ye, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not permitted to us to put any one to death; @ Pilat laĭ hăng gơñu: “Brơi ƀing gih mă ñu hăng phat kơđi ñu tui hăng tơlơi juăt ƀing gih pô.”
Ƀing Yuđa laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gơmơi ƀu hmâo tơlơi dưi phat kơđi pơdjai hlơi ôh” 
that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he spoke, signifying what death he should die. @ Tơlơi anŭn krĕp djơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi Yêsu hmâo pơhiăp laih, tơdang laĭ nao kơ hyư̆m hơdră jơlan Ñu či djai.
Pilate therefore entered again into the praetorium and called Jesus, and said to him, Thou art the king of the Jews? @ Pilat mŭt glaĭ amăng sang pơtao, iâu Yêsu hăng tơña: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ Ih jing pơtao Ană Yuđa?”
Jesus answered [him], Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others said it to thee concerning me? @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ih pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn mơ̆ng ih pô hă, ƀôdah hmâo pô pơkŏn laĭ brơi ih kơ tơlơi Kâo jing?”
Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee up to me: what hast thou done? @ Pilat laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ƀu djơ̆ ană Yuđa ôh. Ƀing kơnŭng djuai ih pô hăng ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hmâo jao ih kơ kâo. Hơgĕt tơlơi ih hmâo ngă?”
Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had fought that I might not be delivered up to the Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Dêh čar pơtao Kâo ƀu lơ̆m kơ lŏn tơnah anai ôh. Tơdah dêh čar pơtao Kâo lơ̆m kơ lŏn tơnah anai, ƀing ding kơna Kâo či pơblah, kiăng kơ arăng ƀu dưi jao kâo kơ ƀing ană Yuđa ôh. Samơ̆ dêh čar pơtao Kâo ƀu lơ̆m kơ lŏn tơnah anai ôh.”
Pilate therefore said to him, Thou art then a king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest [it], that I am a king. I have been born for this, and for this I have come into the world, that I might bear witness to the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice. @ Pilat laĭ: “Tui anŭn ih jing pơtao hă?” Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Sĭt djơ̆ yơh, ih laĭ Kâo jing pơtao. Yua kơ tơlơi anŭn arăng hmâo tơkeng laih Kâo, hăng yua kơ tơlơi anŭn mơ̆n Kâo hmâo rai laih amăng lŏn tơnah, anŭn yơh kiăng ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ tơlơi sĭt. Hlơi pô lơ̆m kơ tơlơi sĭt leng kơ hmư̆ hiăp Kâo.”
Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this he went out again to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault whatever in him. @ Pilat tơña: “Hơgĕt jing tơlơi sĭt?”
Giơ̆ng kơ Pilat laĭ tơlơi anŭn, ñu tơbiă nao pơ ƀing ană Yuđa dơ̆ng hăng laĭ kơ gơñu: “Kâo ƀu ƀuh ôh tơlơi soh amăng Ñu. 
But ye have a custom that I release [some] one to you at the passover; will ye therefore that I release unto you the king of the Jews? @ Samơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi phiăn ƀing gih kâo či pŏk brơi kơ ƀing gih sa čô mơnă ƀơi hrơi phĕt Tơlơi Găn. Ƀing gih kiăng mơ̆ kâo phư brơi pơtao ană Yuđa kơ ƀing gih?”
They cried therefore again all, saying, Not this [man], but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber. @ Samơ̆ gơñu ur kraih hăng laĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ mơnuih anai ôh, samơ̆ pŏk brơi bĕ kơ gơmơi Barabas!” Barabas jing sa čô mơnuih klĕ dŏp.
Then Pilate therefore took Jesus and scourged [him]. @ Giơ̆ng kơ tơlơi anŭn, Pilat mă Yêsu hăng brơi ƀing tơhan taih Ñu hăng gai hnuăt ngă hăng hrĕ klĭ. 
And the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns put it on his head, and put a purple robe on him, @ Ƀing tơhan mơñam sa boh mŭk pơtao ngă hăng drơi, hăng đua brơi ƀơi akŏ Yêsu. Laih anŭn gơñu mă ao phyung mriah buh brơi kơ Yêsu. 
and came to him and said, Hail, king of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face. @ Gơñu nao pơ Yêsu hăng laĭ: “Kơkuh kơ Ih, Ơ Pơtao ană Yuđa” Laih anŭn gơñu pah meng Yêsu.
And Pilate went out again and says to them, Lo, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find in him no fault whatever. @ Pilat tơbiă nao sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng hăng laĭ kơ ƀing ană Yuđa: “Lăng anai, kâo ba tơbiă Ñu kơ ƀing gih, kiăng kơ ƀing ih thâo kâo ƀu ƀuh ôh sa mơta tơlơi soh amăng Ñu.” 
(Jesus therefore went forth without, wearing the crown of thorn, and the purple robe.) And he says to them, Behold the man! @ Tui anŭn Yêsu tơbiă nao, akŏ Ñu đua mŭk pơtao ngă hăng drơi laih anŭn buh ao phyung mriah. Pilat laĭ hăng gơñu: “Lăng bĕ, mơnuih anai!”
When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him they cried out saying, Crucify, crucify [him]. Pilate says to them, Take him ye and crucify [him], for I find no fault in him. @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing tơhan ƀuh Ñu, gơñu ur kraih: “Pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal bĕ! Pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal bĕ!”
Pilat laĭ kơ ƀing anŭn: “Ƀing gih pô mă ba bĕ Ñu hăng pơ̆ng pơ kơyâo bơrơkal, yua kơ kâo ƀu ƀuh ôh sa mơta tơlơi soh amăng Ñu.” 
The Jews answered him, We have a law, and according to [our] law he ought to die, because he made himself Son of God. @ Ƀing ană Yuđa laĭ glaĭ: “Gơmơi hmâo sa tơlơi juăt laih anŭn tui hăng tơlơi juăt anŭn Ñu khŏm djai, yua kơ Ñu laĭ Ñu pô jing Ană Ơi Adai.”
When Pilate therefore heard this word, he was the rather afraid, @ Tơ Pilat hmư̆ boh pơhiăp anŭn ñu hwĭ kơtang hloh. 
and went into the praetorium again and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer. @ Ñu mŭt glaĭ amăng sang pơtao hăng tơña kơ Yêsu: “Mơ̆ng pă ih rai?”
Samơ̆ Yêsu ƀu laĭ glaĭ ôh. 
Pilate therefore says to him, Speakest thou not to *me*? Dost thou not know that I have authority to release thee and have authority to crucify thee? @ Tui anŭn Pilat laĭ kơ Ñu: “Hyư̆m Ih ƀu kiăng pơhiăp hăng kâo? Ih ƀu thâo ôh hă kâo hmâo tơlơi dưi phư brơi ih ƀôdah pơ̆ng hĭ ih pơ kơyâo bơrơkal?” 
Jesus answered, Thou hadst no authority whatever against me if it were not given to thee from above. On this account he that has delivered me up to thee has [the] greater sin. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Ih ƀu hmâo tơlơi dưi ngă kơ Kâo ôh, tơdah Ơi Adai ƀu brơi tơlơi dưi anŭn kơ ih. Yua kơ anŭn yơh, hlơi pô jao Kâo kơ ih tơlơi soh ñu prŏng hloh dơ̆ng.” 
From this time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews cried out saying, If thou releasest this [man], thou art not a friend to Caesar. Every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar. @ Giơ̆ng hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, Pilat hơduah jơlan kiăng phư hĭ Yêsu, samơ̆ ƀing ană Yuđa ur kraih: “Tơdah ih phư brơi mơnuih anai, ih ƀu jing giăng mah hăng Sêsar ôh. Yua kơ hlơi pô pơjing ñu pô jing pơtao, ñu pơkơdơ̆ng hăng Sêsar yơh.”
Pilate therefore, having heard these words, led Jesus out and sat down upon [the] judgment-seat, at a place called Pavement, but in Hebrew Gabbatha; @ Tơ Pilat hmư̆ hơdôm boh pơhiăp anŭn, ñu ba Yêsu pơ gah rơngiao hăng dŏ ber ƀơi gre phat kơđi ƀơi anih arăng pia Wăl Tap Boh Pơtâo, amăng tơlơi Hêbrơ arăng pia Gabatha. 
(now it was [the] preparation of the passover; it was about the sixth hour;) and he says to the Jews, Behold your king! @ Hlăk anŭn jing hrơi prăp rơmet kơ phĕt Tơlơi Găn amăng kơplah wah yang hrơi dơ̆ng. Pilat laĭ kơ ƀing ană Yuđa: “Anai jing pơtao ƀing gih!” 
But they cried out, Take [him] away, take [him] away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your king? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar. @ Gơñu ur kraih: “Pơdjai hĭ Ñu, pơdjai hĭ Ñu, pơ̆ng Ñu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal!” Pilat laĭ: “Hyư̆m ƀing gih kiăng kâo pơ̆ng hĭ pơtao ƀing gih pơ kơyâo bơrơkal?” Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng laĭ glaĭ: “Gơmơi ƀu hmâo pơtao pơkŏn dơ̆ng ôh, kơnơ̆ng hơjăn Sêsar đôč.” 
Then therefore he delivered him up to them, that he might be crucified; and they took Jesus and led him away. @ Tui anŭn Pilat jao Yêsu kơ gơñu, brơi gơñu pơ̆ng hĭ Ñu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal.
Giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu mă Yêsu hăng ba nao mơtam. 
And he went out, bearing his cross, to the place called [place] of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha; @ Yêsu tơbiă nao, glăm kơyâo bơrơkal Ñu pô truh pơ anih Klang Akŏ, arăng pia amăng tơlơi Hêbrơ Gôlgôtha. 
where they crucified him, and with him two others, [one] on this side, and [one] on that, and Jesus in the middle. @ Pơ anŭn gơñu pơ̆ng Yêsu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal, hrŏm hơbĭt hăng dua čô mơnuih pơkŏn, sa čô gah iao, sa čô gah hơnuă, laih anŭn Yêsu tơ̆ng krah. 
And Pilate wrote a title also and put it on the cross. But there was written: Jesus the Nazaraean, the King of the Jews. @ Pilat čih sa pŏk hơnal hăng yol ƀơi ngŏ kơyâo bơrơkal. Hnal anŭn čih tui anai: “YÊSU NASARET, PƠTAO ANĂ YUĐA.” 
This title therefore many of the Jews read, for the place of the city where Jesus was crucified was near; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin. @ Lu ƀing ană Yuđa lăng hơnal anŭn, yua kơ anih ƀing tơhan pơ̆ng Yêsu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal giăm plei prŏng; hơnal anŭn arăng čih hăng tơlơi Hêbrơ, tơlơi Latin, tơlơi Grek. 
The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Do not write, The king of the Jews, but that *he* said, I am king of the Jews. @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng ană Yuđa laĭ kơ Pilat: “Anăm čih ôh: ‘Pơtao Ană Yuđa’ samơ̆ brơi čih: ‘Pô anai laĭ, Kâo jing pơtao ƀing Yuđa.’” 
Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written. @ Pilat laĭ glaĭ: “Tơlơi kâo hmâo čih laih, kâo ƀu pơplih dơ̆ng tah.”
The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his clothes, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and the body-coat; but the body-coat was seamless, woven through the whole from the top. @ Giơ̆ng kơ ƀing tơhan pơ̆ng Yêsu pơ kơyâo bơrơkal, gơñu mă ao phyung Yêsu laih anŭn pơpha pă črăn, sa črăn kơ rĭm čô tơhan.

They said therefore to one another, Let us not rend it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted my garments among themselves, and on my vesture they cast lots. The soldiers therefore did these things. @ Tui anŭn gơñu bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu: “Anăm ƀing ta hek hĭ ao anai ôh, samơ̆ brơi ƀing ta mă pơčrăm kiăng thâo kơ hlơi pô či djơ̆.” Tơlơi anŭn kiăng krĕp djơ̆ Hră Ơi Adai pơhiăp čih laih:

Anŭn jing bruă ƀing tơhan hmâo ngă.
And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and the sister of his mother, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. @ Dŏ giăm kơyâo bơrơkal Yêsu hmâo amĭ Ñu, amai amĭ Ñu, hrŏm hăng HʼMari bơnai Klôpas laih anŭn HʼMari Plei Madala. 
Jesus therefore, seeing his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son. @ 59 Yêsu ƀuh amĭ Ñu hăng ding kơna pô Ñu khăp hlăk dŏ jĕ, Yêsu laĭ kơ amĭ Ñu: “Ơ amĭ, anai jing ană đah rơkơi ih!” 
Then he says unto the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. @ Laih anŭn Ñu laĭ kơ ding kơna anŭn: “Anai jing amĭ ih” Mơ̆ng mông anŭn ding kơna anŭn jak ba HʼMari glaĭ pơ sang ñu pô.
After this, Jesus, knowing that all things were now finished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, says, I thirst. @ Giơ̆ng kơ tơlơi anŭn, Yêsu thâo abih bang bruă hmâo giơ̆ng yơh, kiăng ngă krĕp djơ̆ Tơlơi Ơi Adai pơhiăp čih laih, Ñu laĭ: “Kâo mơhao.”
There was a vessel therefore there full of vinegar, and having filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting hyssop round it, they put it up to his mouth. @ Pơ anŭn hmâo sa boh get bă hăng ia tơpai mơsăm. Gơñu mă pông diăn añrŭ amăng ia mơsăm gơñu kă ƀơi sa ƀĕ than hisôp laih anŭn čŭt nao ƀơi tơƀuai Yêsu. 
When therefore Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and having bowed his head, he delivered up his spirit. @ Tơ Yêsu mơñum laih ia tơpai mơsăm, Ñu laĭ: “Abih bang bruă giơ̆ng laih!” Laih anŭn Ñu kŭp akŏ, tơĭ pran.
The Jews therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for it was [the] preparation, (for the day of that sabbath was a great [day],) demanded of Pilate that their legs might be broken and they taken away. @ Yua kơ hrơi anŭn jing hrơi prăp rơmet kơ phĕt Tơlơi Găn, laih anŭn ƀing Yuđa ƀu kiăng drơi jan dŏ ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal tơdang hrơi saƀat (Yua kơ hrơi saƀat anŭn jing hrơi pơyom biă mă), ƀing Yuđa rơkâo Pilat brơi arăng taih joh hĭ tơkai gơñu, laih anŭn mă pơđuaĭ hĭ gơñu pơ anih pơkŏn. 
The soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first and of the other that had been crucified with him; @ Hnŭn yơh ƀing tơhan nao taih joh hĭ klang thông pô tal hlâo, hăng pô pơkŏn jing dua čô arăng pơ̆ng ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu. 
but coming to Jesus, when they saw that he was already dead they did not break his legs, @ Samơ̆ tơ gơñu nao jĕ pơ Yêsu gơñu ƀuh Ñu djai laih, hnŭn yơh ƀing tơhan ƀu taih joh klang thông Yêsu ôh. 
but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water. @ Samơ̆ hmâo sa čô amăng ƀing tơhan klaŏ ƀơi djeo Ñu hăng tơbăk laih anŭn drah hăng ia ƀlĕ mơtam. 
And he who saw it bears witness, and his witness is true, and he knows that he says true that ye also may believe. @ Pô hmâo ƀuh tơlơi anŭn ngă gơ̆ng jơlan, tơlơi ñu ngă gơ̆ng jơlan anŭn jing sĭt, laih anŭn ñu ăt thâo mơ̆n kơ tơlơi ñu pơhiăp anŭn jing sĭt, kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi đaŏ mơ̆n. 
For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, Not a bone of him shall be broken. @ Hơdôm tơlơi anai hmâo truh kiăng kơ krĕp djơ̆ tui hăng Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih: “Ƀu hmâo ôh sa ƀĕ klang Ñu či joh hĭ.” 
And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced. @ Laih anŭn hmâo Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp tui anai dơ̆ng: “Gơñu či lăng kơ pô gơñu hmâo klaŏ laih.”
And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly through fear of the Jews, demanded of Pilate that he might take the body of Jesus: and Pilate allowed it. He came therefore and took away the body of Jesus. @ Giơ̆ng kơ anŭn Yôsep plei Arimathê, jing sa čô ding kơna Yêsu, hăng tơlơi hơgơ̆m yua kơ ñu hwĭ kơ ƀing Yuđa, nao rơkâo Pilat tơlơi dưi mă drơi jan Yêsu. Pilat brơi mơ̆n. Tui anŭn ñu nao mă drơi jan Yêsu. 
And Nicodemus also, who at first came to Jesus by night, came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds [weight]. @ Nikôđem, pô hlâo anŭn hmâo nao pơ Yêsu sa wơ̆t amăng mlam, ăt nao mơ̆n, djă ba sa rơtuh kilôgram ia jrao phĭ ƀâu hiam lŭk hăng ia jrao alôê. 
They took therefore the body of Jesus and bound it up in linen with the spices, as it is the custom with the Jews to prepare for burial. @ Gơñu mă atâo Yêsu, hăng pŏn drơi jan Yêsu hăng khăn kơbuă laih anŭn hrŏm hăng ia jrao ƀâu hiam, tui hăng tơlơi phiăn ƀing Yuđa dơr mơnuih djai. 
But there was in the place where he had been crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid. @ Ƀơi jĕ anih arăng pơ̆ng Yêsu anŭn hmâo sa boh đang kơyâo, amăng đang kơyâo anŭn hmâo sa boh pơsat phrâo, arăng aka dơr mơnuih djai ôh. 
There therefore, on account of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus. @ Yua kơ hrơi anŭn jing hrơi ƀing Yuđa prăp pre kơ phĕt Tơlơi Găn, gơñu pioh Yêsu amăng pơsat anŭn, yua kơ pơsat jĕ ƀơi anŭn.
And on the first [day] of the week Mary of Magdala comes in early morn to the tomb, while it was still dark, and sees the stone taken away from the tomb. @ Ưm mơguah hrơi tal sa amăng hrơi kơ̆m HʼMari Madala nao pơsat, tơdang adai dŏ mơmŏt, ƀuh boh pơtâo tơglung hĭ laih mơ̆ng bah amăng pơsat. 
She runs therefore and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, to whom Jesus was attached, and says to them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him. @ Tui anŭn ñu nao pơ Simôn Pêtrôs laih anŭn pơ sa čô ding kơna pơkŏn, jing pô Yêsu khăp, laih anŭn laĭ: “Arăng hmâo ba pơđuaĭ laih Khua Yang mơ̆ng pơsat laih anŭn gơmơi ƀu thâo ôh pơpă anih arăng pioh hĭ Ñu.”
Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and came to the tomb. @ Tui anŭn Pêtrôs hăng ding kơna pơkŏn anŭn, tơbiă nao pơ pơsat mơtam. 
And the two ran together, and the other disciple ran forward faster than Peter, and came first to the tomb, @ Abih dua gơñu đuaĭ hrŏm, samơ̆ ding kơna pơkŏn anŭn đuaĭ hơmăr hloh kơ Pêtrôs hăng truh hlâo pơ pơsat. 
and stooping down he sees the linen cloths lying; he did not however go in. @ Ñu tơkui ep lăng amăng pơsat, ƀuh khăn kơbuă ăt dŏ ƀơi anŭn, samơ̆ ñu ƀu mŭt amăng pơsat ôh. 
Simon Peter therefore comes, following him, and entered into the tomb, and sees the linen cloths lying, @ Simôn Pêtrôs truh tơdơi kơ ñu hăng mŭt amăng lăm pơsat mơtam. Gơ̆ ƀuh khăn kơbuă ƀơi anŭn, 
and the handkerchief which was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a distinct place by itself. @ samơ̆ khăn arăng klŭm akŏ Yêsu ƀu dŏ hrŏm hăng khăn kơbuă anŭn ôh, samơ̆ lŏp hĭ hăng pioh phara anih. 
Then entered in therefore the other disciple also who came first to the tomb, and he saw and believed; @ Hlăk anŭn ding kơna pơkŏn anŭn, pô truh hlâo pơ pơsat, ăt mŭt amăng pơsat mơ̆n. Gơ̆ ƀuh hăng đaŏ. 
for they had not yet known the scripture, that he must rise from among [the] dead. @ Hlăk anŭn gơñu ăt aka ƀu thâo hluh ôh Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih kơ Yêsu či hơdip glaĭ dơ̆ng mơ̆ng ƀing djai. 
The disciples therefore went away again to their own home. @ Laih anŭn ƀing ding kơna anŭn glaĭ hĭ pơ sang gơñu pô.
But Mary stood at the tomb weeping without. As therefore she wept, she stooped down into the tomb, @ HʼMari dŏ dơ̆ng hia ƀơi gah rơngiao jĕ pơsat, tơdang ñu hia ñu tơkui ep lăng amăng pơsat, 
and beholds two angels sitting in white [garments], one at the head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. @ ñu ƀuh dua čô ling jang buh ao kŏ dŏ ber ƀơi anih arăng hmâo pioh atâo Yêsu. Sa čô dŏ ƀơi akŏ, sa čô dŏ ƀơi tơkai. 
And they say to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. @ Gơñu tơña: “Ơ đah kơmơi, yua hơgĕt ih hia lĕ?” HʼMari laĭ glaĭ: “Yua kơ arăng hmâo mă pơđuaĭ hĭ Khua Yang kâo, laih anŭn kâo ƀu thâo ôh pơpă anih arăng pioh Ñu.” 
Having said these things she turned backward and beholds Jesus standing [there], and knew not that it was Jesus. @ Tơdang laĭ tui anŭn, ñu wir lăng hăng ƀuh Yêsu dŏ dơ̆ng, samơ̆ ñu ƀu thâo ôh anŭn jing Yêsu. 
Jesus says to her, Woman, why dost thou weep? Whom seekest thou? She, supposing that it was the gardener, says to him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. @ Yêsu tơña ñu: “Ơ đah kơmơi, yua hơgĕt ih hia lĕ?

Jesus says to her, Mary. She, turning round, says to him in Hebrew, Rabboni, which means Teacher. @ Yêsu laĭ: “Ơ HʼMari.” HʼMari wir lăng laih anŭn iâu kơ Ñu hăng tơlơi Hêbrơ: “Rabôni” (kiăng laĭ: “Nai”). 
Jesus says to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, and [to] my God and your God. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Anăm ruaih Kâo ôh, yua kơ Kâo aka đĭ pơ Ama Kâo ôh; samơ̆ nao bĕ pơ ƀing adơi ayŏng Kâo hăng laĭ brơi gơñu: ‘Kâo či đĭ glaĭ pơ Ama Kâo laih anŭn Ama ƀing gih, pơ Ơi Adai Kâo laih anŭn Ơi Adai ƀing gih.’” 
Mary of Magdala comes bringing word to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] he had said these things to her. @ HʼMari Madala nao laĭ brơi kơ ƀing ding kơna: “Kâo ƀuh laih Khua Yang;” laih anŭn ñu ră ruai kơ ƀing ding kơna hơdôm tơlơi Yêsu hmâo laĭ laih kơ ñu.
When therefore it was evening on that day, which was the first [day] of the week, and the doors shut where the disciples were, through fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and says to them, Peace [be] to you. @ Ƀơi klam hrơi anŭn, jing hrơi tal sa amăng hrơi kơ̆m, anih ƀing ding kơna dŏ krư̆ kơđơ̆l hĭ bah amăng yua kơ hwĭ kơ ƀing Yuđa, Yêsu rai hăng dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi tơ̆ng krah ƀing gơñu hăng laĭ: “Rơnŭk rơnua kơ ƀing gih.” 
And having said this, he shewed to them his hands and his side. The disciples rejoiced therefore, having seen the Lord. @ Giơ̆ng kơ pơhiăp, Ñu pơƀuh brơi kơ ƀing gơñu lăng tơngan hăng djeo Ñu. Tơ gơñu ƀuh Khua Yang, ƀing ding kơna hơ̆k mơak biă mă. 
[Jesus] said therefore again to them, Peace [be] to you: as the Father sent me forth, I also send you. @ Yêsu laĭ dơ̆ng: “Rơnŭk rơnua kơ ƀing gih. Kar hăng Ama hmâo pơkiaŏ rai Kâo, Kâo ăt pơkiaŏ ƀing gih kar kaĭ mơ̆n.” 
And having said this, he breathed into [them], and says to them, Receive [the] Holy Spirit: @ Giơ̆ng Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, Ñu bluh ayuh kơ ƀing gơ̆ hăng laĭ: “Mă tŭ bĕ Yang Bơngăt Hiam. 
whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained. @ Tơdah ƀing gih pap brơi tơlơi soh arăng, gơñu či hmâo tơlơi pap brơi; laih anŭn tơdah ƀing gih djă pioh tơlơi soh arăng, tơlơi soh gơñu ăt dŏ đom glaĭ.”
But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. @ Thômas, sa čô amăng ƀing pluh dua čô khua ding kơna, pô arăng pia ană Kơmar, ƀu dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu ôh hlăk Yêsu rai. 
The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails, and put my finger into the mark of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe. @ Tui anŭn ƀing ding kơna pơkŏn laĭ hăng ñu: “Gơmơi hmâo ƀuh laih Khua Yang.” Samơ̆ Thômas laĭ kơ gơñu: “Kâo ƀu či đaŏ ôh, tơdah kâo ƀu ƀuh gru nam rơka kơđĭn amăng tơngan Ñu, laih anŭn čơđeng kâo ƀu ruaih ôh ƀơi nam rơka anŭn, laih anŭn ƀu dưm tơngan kâo ƀơi djeo Ñu.”
And eight days after, his disciples were again within, and Thomas with them. Jesus comes, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace [be] to you. @ Sapăn hrơi tơdơi, ƀing ding kơna Ñu dŏ pơtŭm glaĭ amăng sang anŭn dơ̆ng, laih anŭn Thômas ăt dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu mơ̆n.

Then he says to Thomas, Bring thy finger here and see my hands; and bring thy hand and put it into my side; and be not unbelieving, but believing. @ Laih anŭn Yêsu laĭ kơ Thômas: “Čơđeng ih ruaih bĕ ƀơi anai, hăng lăng bĕ tơngan Kâo; yơr tơngan ih hăng ruaih bĕ djeo Kâo; anăm đing đaŏ ôh, samơ̆ đaŏ bĕ.” 
Thomas answered and said to him, My Lord and my God. @ Thômas laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang kâo, Ơi Adai kâo!” 
Jesus says to him, Because thou hast seen me thou hast believed: blessed they who have not seen and have believed. @ Yêsu laĭ: “Djơ̆ mơ̆ ih đaŏ yua kơ ih ƀuh Kâo? Mơyun hiam yơh kơ ƀing ƀu ƀuh ôh samơ̆ ñu đaŏ.”
Many other signs therefore also Jesus did before his disciples, which are not written in this book; @ Yêsu hmâo ngă lu gru tơlơi mơsêh mơyang pơkŏn dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp ƀing ding kơna Ñu, arăng ƀu čih ôh amăng hơdrôm hră anai; 
but these are written that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name. @ samơ̆ hơdôm tơlơi anai hmâo čih, kiăng kơ ƀing gih đaŏ kơ Yêsu jing Yang Krist, Ană Ơi Adai, laih anŭn hăng tơlơi ƀing gih đaŏ ƀing gih dưi hmâo tơlơi hơdip amăng anăn Ñu.
After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he manifested [himself] thus. @ Giơ̆ng kơ anŭn, Yêsu pơƀuh Ñu Pô dơ̆ng kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu ƀơi hang ia rơsĭ Tibêrias. Tơlơi Ñu pơƀuh rai tui anai: 
There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael who was of Cana of Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. @ Simôn Pêtrôs, Thômas arăng pơanăn pô arăng tơkeng kơmar, Natanel mơ̆ng plei Kana tring Galilê, ƀing ană đah rơkơi Sêbêdê, hăng dua čô ƀing khua ding kơna pơkŏn dŏ pơƀŭt glaĭ hrŏm hơbĭt. 
Simon Peter says to them, I go to fish. They say to him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and went on board, and that night took nothing. @ Simôn Pêtrôs laĭ hăng gơñu: “Kâo nao trah akan.” Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Gơmơi či nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ih mơ̆n.” Gơñu tơbiă nao trŭn amăng sŏng yơh, samơ̆ amăng mlam anŭn gơñu ƀu hmâo hơgĕt gĕt ôh.
And early morn already breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples however did not know that it was Jesus. @ Truh sêng brêng mơguah, Yêsu dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi hang; samơ̆ ƀing khua ding kơna ƀu thâo krăn ôh anŭn jing Yêsu. 
Jesus therefore says to them, Children, have ye anything to eat? They answered him, No. @ Yêsu tơña kơ ƀing gơñu: “Ơ ƀing ană Kâo, ƀing gih ƀu hmâo akan ôh hă?” Gơñu laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀu hmâo ôh.” 
And he said to them, Cast the net at the right side of the ship and ye will find. They cast therefore, and they could no longer draw it, from the multitude of fishes. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Dăng bĕ hơñual gah hơnuă kơ sŏng ƀing gih či hmâo akan yơh.” Tui anŭn gơñu dăng, djơ̆ akan lu biă mă tơl gơñu ƀu anăm dui đĭ ôh. 
That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord. Simon Peter therefore, having heard that it was the Lord, girded his overcoat [on him] (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea; @ Ding kơna pô Yêsu khăp anŭn laĭ hăng Pêtrôs: “Khua Yang yơh anŭn!” Tơ Simôn Pêtrôs hmư̆ anŭn jing Khua Yang, ñu mă ao phyung buh sŏm drơi jan ñu, yua kơ ñu dŏ drơi mơhlŭn, laih anŭn kơdâo trŭn amăng ia. 
and the other disciples came in the small boat, for they were not far from the land, but somewhere about two hundred cubits, dragging the net of fishes. @ Samơ̆ ƀing khua ding kơna pơkŏn waih sŏng rai hrŏm hơbĭt, dui hơñual bă hăng akan, yua kơ gơñu ataih mơ̆ng hang kơnơ̆ng giăm sa rơtuh met đôč. 
When therefore they went out on the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid on it, and bread. @ Tơ gơñu đĭ pơ hang, gơñu ƀuh pơ anŭn hmâo apui hơdăng, ƀơi hăng ngŏ apui anŭn hmâo akan hăng ƀañ tơpŭng. 
Jesus says to them, Bring of the fishes which ye have now taken. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Djă rai bĕ ƀiă akan ƀing gih phrâo mă anŭn pơ anai.” 
Simon Peter went up and drew the net to the land full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not rent. @ Tui anŭn Simôn Pêtrôs đĭ amăng sŏng hăng dui hơñual nao pơ hang, bă hăng sa rơtuh rơma pluh klâo drơi akan prŏng; wơ̆t dah akan lu kar hăng anŭn jal ƀu tơĭ ôh. 
Jesus says to them, Come [and] dine. But none of the disciples dared inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord. @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Rai ƀơ̆ng bĕ.” Ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô amăng ƀing khua ding kơna khĭn tơña kơ Ñu: “Hlơi ih jing?” Yua kơ gơñu thâo sĭt anŭn jing Khua Yang. 
Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives it to them, and the fish in like manner. @ Yêsu nao, mă ƀañ tơpŭng brơi kơ gơñu, laih anŭn brơi wơ̆t akan mơ̆n. 
This is already the third time that Jesus had been manifested to the disciples, being risen from among [the] dead. @ Anŭn jing tal klâo Yêsu pơƀuh Ñu pô kơ ƀing khua ding kơna Ñu, tơdơi kơ Ñu hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng ƀing djai.
When therefore they had dined, Jesus says to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Feed my lambs. @ Giơ̆ng kơ gơñu ƀơ̆ng huă, Yêsu pơhiăp hăng Simôn Pêtrôs: “Ơ Simôn ană Yôhan, ih khăp kơ Kâo hloh kơ ƀing anai mơ̆?” Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, Ih thâo laih kâo khăp kơ Ih.”
Yêsu laĭ dơ̆ng: “Čem rong bĕ khul ană triu Kâo.” 
He says to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? He says to him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. He says to him, Shepherd my sheep. @ Yêsu pơhiăp hăng ñu tal dua: “Ơ Simôn ană Yôhan, ih khăp kơ Kâo mơ̆?”
Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, Ih thâo laih kâo khăp kơ Ih.”
Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Wai lăng bĕ khul triu Kâo.” 
He says to him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, art thou attached to me? Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, Art thou attached to me? and said to him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I am attached to thee. Jesus says to him, Feed my sheep. @ Yêsu pơhiăp hăng ñu tal klâo: “Ơ Simôn ană Yôhan, ih khăp kơ Kâo mơ̆?”
Pêtrôs rơngot yua kơ Yêsu tơña kơ ñu truh kơ klâo wơ̆t: “Ih khăp kơ Kâo mơ̆?” Tui anŭn Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, Ih thâo abih bang tơlơi, Ih thâo laih Kâo khăp kơ Ih.”
Yêsu laĭ kơ ñu: “Čem rong bĕ khul triu Kâo. 
Verily, verily, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst where thou desiredst; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and bring thee where thou dost not desire. @ Kâo laĭ sĭt biă mă kơ ih, tơdang ih hlăk dŏ tơdăm, ih hrăng mă hơdrăng kơiăng ih pô, hăng nao pơpă anih ih kiăng; samơ̆ tơ ih tha laih, ih či yơr tơngan, laih anŭn pô pơkŏn či hrăng brơi hơdrăng kơiăng kơ ih, hăng či dui ba ih pơ anih ih ƀu kiăng nao ôh.” 
But he said this signifying by what death he should glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, Follow me. @ Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn kiăng laĭ nao hyư̆m jơlan Pêtrôs či djai kiăng ngă ư-ang kơ Ơi Adai. Giơ̆ng Yêsu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, Yêsu laĭ kơ Pêtrôs: “Đuaĭ tui Kâo bĕ.”
Peter, turning round, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned at supper on his breast, and said, Lord, who is it that delivers thee up? @ Pêtrôs wir glaĭ ƀuh ding kơna Yêsu khăp hlăk đuaĭ tui tơdơi, jing pô hmâo ah boh akŏ ƀơi tơda Yêsu amăng sa tơlơi ƀơ̆ng huă anŭn laih anŭn tơña kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Khua Yang, hlơi pô či pơblư̆ lui Ih?” 
Peter, seeing him, says to Jesus, Lord, and what [of] this [man]? @ Tơ ƀuh pô anŭn, Pêtrôs tơña kơ Yêsu: “Ơ Khua Yang, bơ kơ pô anai hơgĕt tơlơi či truh kơ ñu lĕ?”
Jesus says to him, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me. @ Yêsu laĭ glaĭ: “Tơdah Kâo kiăng kơ ñu dŏ hơdip tơl Kâo rai dơ̆ng, hơgĕt tơlơi anŭn djơ̆ kơ ih? Gah kơ ih, đuaĭ tui Kâo bĕ!” 
This word therefore went out among the brethren, That disciple does not die. And Jesus did not say to him, He does not die; but, If I will that he abide until I come, what [is that] to thee? @ Yua kơ anŭn, hmâo tơlơi hmư̆ hing tơ̆ng krah ƀing adơi ayŏng đaŏ kơ khua ding kơna anŭn ƀu či djai ôh; Yêsu ƀu laĭ ôh kơ khua ding kơna anŭn ƀu či djai, samơ̆ Ñu laĭ “Tơdah Kâo kiăng ñu dŏ hơdip tơl Kâo rai dơ̆ng, hơgĕt tơlơi anŭn djơ̆ kơ ih?”
This is the disciple who bears witness concerning these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his witness is true. @ Ding kơna anŭn yơh jing pô ngă gơ̆ng jơlan, hăng hmâo čih laih abih tơlơi anai; laih anŭn ƀing ta thâo kơ tơlơi ñu ngă gơ̆ng jơlan jing sĭt.
And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would contain the books written. @ Yêsu hmâo ngă lu tơlơi pơkŏn dơ̆ng mơ̆n.

to whom also he presented himself living, after he had suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of God; @ Amăng pă pluh hrơi giơ̆ng kơ Ñu djai Ñu hmâo pơƀuh brơi kơ gơñu lu wơ̆t hăng lu gru mơsêh mơyang, Ñu pơsĭt kơ gơñu thâo Ñu ăt dŏ hơdip, gơñu ƀuh Yêsu laih anŭn Yêsu pơtô gơñu kơ dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai. 
and, being assembled with [them], commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father, which [said he] ye have heard of me. @ Tơdang Ñu dŏ bơjơnum hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing khua ding kơna, Ñu pơtă kơ ƀing gơñu tui anai: “Anăm ƀing gih tơbiă mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem ôh, samơ̆ dŏ tơguan bĕ kơ tơlơi Ama hmâo ƀuăn laih, jing tơlơi Kâo hmâo laĭ laih kơ ƀing gih. 
For John indeed baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days. @ Yua kơ Yôhan hmâo ngă laih ƀatem hăng ia, samơ̆ dŏ ƀiă hrơi dơ̆ng ƀing gih či tŭ ƀatem hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam.”
They therefore, being come together, asked him saying, Lord, is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel? @ Tơdang ƀing khua ding kơna dŏ bơjơnum hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yêsu, gơñu tơña: “Ơ Khua Yang, djơ̆ mơ̆ ră anai Ih či pơdơ̆ng glaĭ Dêh Čar Pơtao Israel?”
And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority; @ Yêsu laĭ kơ gơñu: “Kơ rơnŭk ƀôdah bơyan Ama Kâo hmâo pơkă laih tui hăng tơlơi dưi Ñu pô, tơlơi anŭn ƀing gih ƀu dưi thâo ôh.

And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding [him], and a cloud received him out of their sight. @ Giơ̆ng kơ Ñu pơhiăp khul tơlơi anŭn, Ơi Adai pŭ Ñu đĭ pơ adai tơdang ƀing khua ding kơna Ñu dŏ lăng, laih anŭn hmâo sa ƀŭt hiăng rai gom hĭ Ñu, laih anŭn gơñu ƀu thâo ƀuh Ñu dơ̆ng ôh.
And as they were gazing into heaven, as he was going, behold, also two men stood by them in white clothing, @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ lăng đĭ ƀu ƀleh mơta ôh hlăk Yêsu đĭ glaĭ pơ adai, plŭt hmâo dua čô đah rơkơi buh ao phyung kŏ dŏ dơ̆ng giăm gơñu, 
who also said, Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into heaven?

Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called [the mount] of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's journey off. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn mơ̆ng čư̆ arăng pia čư̆ Ôliwơ gơñu glaĭ pơ Yêrusalem, čư̆ anŭn jĕ plei Yêrusalem, sa rơwang phiăn arăng rơbat amăng hrơi saƀat. 
And when they were come into [the city], they went up to the upper chamber, where were staying both Peter, and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James [son] of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude [the brother] of James. @ Tơ gơñu mŭt laih amăng plei, gơñu đĭ pơ adŭ tal glong, ƀơi anih gơñu juăt dŏ.

These gave themselves all with one accord to continual prayer, with [several] women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren. @ Abih bang ƀing anŭn sa pran jua, sa tơlơi pơmĭn iâu laĭ, hrŏm hăng ƀing đah kơmơi, hrŏm hơbĭt hăng HʼMari amĭ Yêsu laih anŭn hăng ƀing adơi ayŏng Ñu.
And in those days Peter, standing up in the midst of the brethren, said, (the crowd of names [who were] together [was] about a hundred and twenty,) @ Amăng khul hrơi anŭn, Pêtrôs tơgŭ dơ̆ng tơ̆ng krah ƀing adơi ayŏng (Hmâo năng ai sa rơtuh dua pluh čô), hăng laĭ, 
Brethren, it was necessary that the scripture should have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before, by the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus; @ “Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, krĕp djơ̆ yơh Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih, tơlơi anŭn Yang Bơngăt Hiam hmâo laĭ hlâo laih hăng amăng bah Đawit, djơ̆ kơ Yudas pô hmâo ba jơlan kơ arăng mă čăp Yêsu. 
for he was numbered amongst us, and had received a part in this service. @ Yua kơ ñu ăt jing sa čô amăng ƀing ta, laih anŭn ñu hmâo črăn bruă hrŏm hăng ƀing ta.”
(This [man] then indeed got a field with [the] reward of iniquity, and, having fallen down headlong, burst in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. @  “Đah rơkơi anŭn hmâo blơi laih sa blah hmua hăng prăk apah kơ tơlơi soh ñu.

‘Brơi sa čô pô pơkŏn hrua mă bĕ bruă ñu.’
It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have assembled with us all [the] time in which the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, @ Tui anŭn brơi sa čô mơnuih amăng ƀing hmâo đuaĭ tui laih ƀing ta amăng abih hrơi Khua Yang Yêsu hyu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ta,

And they appointed two, Joseph, who was called Barsabas, who had been surnamed Justus, and Matthias. @ Gơñu črâo brơi dua čô, Yôsep arăng iâu Barsabas, ăt pơanăn dơ̆ng Justus, laih anŭn Mathias.

And they gave lots on them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. @ Giơ̆ng kơ anŭn gơñu mă pơčrăm kơ dua čô anŭn, laih anŭn tơlơi mă pơčrăm anŭn djơ̆ kơ Mathias; tui anŭn arăng yap ñu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng pluh sa čô khua ding kơna.
And when the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, they were all together in one place. @  Tơ hrơi phĕt Pantơkôt truh, abih bang gơñu bơjơnum glaĭ amăng sa boh anih. 
And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they were sitting. @ Plŭt hmâo dơnai rai mơ̆ng adai kar hăng jua angĭn thut kơtang, pơbă abih amăng sang anih gơñu hlăk dŏ ber.

But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke forth to them, Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my words: @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs tơgŭ hrŏm hăng ƀing pluh sa čô ding kơna, pơhiăp kraih hăng ƀing anŭn: “Ơ ƀing Yuđa laih anŭn abih bang mơnuih dŏ amăng plei Yêrusalem, brơi ƀing gih thâo tơlơi anai, hăng pơđing tơngia kơ tơlơi kâo pơhiăp.

And it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem, @ Mơguah pơgi ƀing khua gơñu, ƀing kŏng tha, ƀing nai pơtô hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt pơtŭm glaĭ pơ Yêrusalem

Then Peter, filled with [the] Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders [of Israel], @ Hlăk anŭn Pêtrôs bă blai Yang Bơngăt Hiam, laĭ glaĭ kơ gơñu: “Ơ ƀing khua wai lăng ƀing ană plei hăng ƀing kŏng tha,

But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlettered and uninstructed men, they wondered; and they recognised them that they were with Jesus. @ Tơ gơñu ƀuh tơlơi khĭn Pêtrôs hăng Yôhan, gơñu thâo klă dua gơñu jing mơnuih plei pla ƀu hmâo hrăm hră ôh, gơñu kơtuă hling biă mă.

And beholding the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to reply; @ Samơ̆ tơ gơñu ƀuh đah rơkơi rơwen hmâo suaih laih dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt Pêtrôs hăng Yôhan, hnŭn yơh gơñu ƀu dưi pơgăl hăng dua gơñu ôh.

And having called them, they charged [them] not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. @ Tui anŭn gơñu iâu dua gơ̆ mŭt, hăng khă kơ dua gơñu anăm pơhiăp ƀôdah pơtô hăng anăn Yêsu dơ̆ng ôh. 
But Peter and John answering said to them, If it be righteous before God to listen to you rather than to God, judge ye; @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs hăng Yôhan laĭ glaĭ: “Brơi ƀing gih kơsem pơmĭn bĕ, hơgĕt jing djơ̆ hloh ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai, gưt kơ ƀing gih ƀôdah gưt kơ Ơi Adai?

But they, having further threatened them, let them go, finding no way how they might punish them, on account of the people, because all glorified God for what had taken place; @ Tui anŭn, giơ̆ng gơñu pơhiăp pơhwĭ kơ dua ñu, gơñu phư lui ƀing gơ̆ yơh, yua kơ gơñu ƀu dưi hơduah ƀuh jơlan kiăng kơ pơkơhmal dua gơñu ôh, yua kơ abih bang ƀing ană plei pla leng kơ pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai kơ tơlơi hmâo truh laih.

And they, having heard [it], lifted up [their] voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them; @ Giơ̆ng gơñu hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơñu sa pran jua hrŏm hơbĭt iâu laĭ kơ Ơi Adai: “Ơ Khua Yang, Pô hrih adai, lŏn tơnah, ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn abih bang mơnơ̆ng amăng anŭn,

And when they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness. @ Giơ̆ng kơ gơñu Iâu laĭ, anih gơñu bơjơnum pơpư̆ pơgơi.

And when they heard it, they entered very early into the temple and taught. And when the high priest was come, and they that were with him, they called together the council and all the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. @ Hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, mơguah ưm gơñu mŭt amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ laih anŭn čơdơ̆ng pơtô.

And when the officers were come, they did not find them in the prison; and returned and reported @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing khua tơhan truh pơ sang mơnă, gơñu ƀu ƀuh dơ̆ng tah ƀing khua ding kơna dŏ amăng sang mơnă. Gơñu glaĭ hăng laĭ pơthâo tơlơi anŭn hăng laĭ, 
saying, We found the prison shut with all security, and the keepers standing at the doors; but when we had opened [them], within we found no one. @ “Gơmơi ƀuh sang mơnă khuă kơjăp khŏp, laih anŭn ƀing tơhan ăt dŏ gak ƀơi bah amăng, samơ̆ tơ gơmơi pŏk bah amăng, gơmơi ƀu ƀuh sa čô mơnuih amăng anŭn ôh.” 
And when they heard these words, both the priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests were in perplexity as to them, what this would come to. @ Giơ̆ng hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, khua tơhan wai lăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ laih anŭn ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hmâo tơlơi rŭng răng yua ƀing khua ding kơna anŭn, ƀu thâo ôh hyư̆m tơlơi anai či jing. 
And some one coming reported to them, Lo, the men whom ye put in the prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the people. @ Hmâo sa čô rai hăng laĭ pơthâo kơ gơñu: “Gih lăng adih, ƀing mơnuih ƀing gih hmâo krư̆ anŭn, ră anai gơñu dŏ pơtô laĭ kơ ƀing ană plei amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ.” 
Then the captain, having gone with the officers, brought them, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned. @ Giơ̆ng kơ anŭn khua kơ ƀing tơhan wai lăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng tơhan ñu nao mă ƀing khua ding kơna, samơ̆ ƀu khĭn ngă sat ôh, yua kơ gơñu hwĭ kơ ƀing ană plei glŏm boh pơtâo kơ gơñu.
And they bring them and set them in the council. And the high priest asked them, @ Giơ̆ng gơñu mă ba ƀing khua ding kơna, gơñu ba ƀing gơ̆ ƀơi anăp ƀing khua phat kơđi. Khua ngă yang prŏng hloh tơña kơ ƀing gơ̆, laĭ, 
saying, We strictly enjoined you not to teach in this name: and lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and purpose to bring upon us the blood of this man. @ “Gơmơi hmâo khă laih ƀing gih kơtang kơtĭt ƀu brơi pơtô amăng anăn anai ôh, samơ̆ ƀing gih hmâo ngă pơbă amăng plei Yêrusalem hăng tơlơi ƀing gih pơtô, laih anŭn ƀing gih kiăng drah Mơnuih anŭn tuh ƀơi ƀing gơmơi dơ̆ng hă!”
But Peter answering, and the apostles, said, God must be obeyed rather than men. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs hăng ƀing khua ding kơna laĭ glaĭ: “Gơmơi khŏm gưt kơ Ơi Adai, hloh kơ gưt kơ mơnuih.

But they, when they heard [these things], were cut to the heart, and took counsel to kill them. @ Tơ hmư̆ hơdôm tơlơi anŭn gơñu hil biă mă laih anŭn gơñu kiăng pơdjai hĭ ƀing khua ding kơna. 
But a certain [man], a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, held in honour of all the people, rose up in the council, and commanded to put the men out for a short while, @ Samơ̆ sa čô Pharisi, amăng ƀing khua phat kơđi, anăn ñu Gamaliel, sa čô nai pơtô tơlơi juăt ƀing ană plei pla pơpŭ biă mă, tơgŭ dơ̆ng pơđar kơ arăng brơi ƀing khua ding kơna tơbiă hĭ pơ gah rơngiao amăng ƀiă mông. 
and said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as regards these men what ye are going to do; @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ñu laĭ kơ ƀing khua phat kơđi: “Ơ ƀing ană plei pla Israel, răng bĕ kơ tơlơi ƀing gih ngă kơ ƀing anai. 
for before these days Theudas rose up, alleging himself to be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, were joined; who was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were dispersed and came to nothing. @ Hlăk hlâo adih Thiôdas tơgŭ đĭ, pơhaih kơ ñu pô jing sa čô khua gĭt gai, laih anŭn hmâo giăm pă rơtuh čô mơnuih đuaĭ tui ñu; samơ̆ arăng pơdjai hĭ ñu, laih anŭn abih bang ƀing đuaĭ tui ñu čơlah hĭ bru bra, laih anŭn bruă gơñu ngă ƀu jing ôh. 
After him rose Judas the Galilean in the days of the census, and drew away [a number of] people after him; and *he* perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered abroad. @ Tơdơi kơ ñu, hmâo dơ̆ng Yudas mơnuih Galilê tơgŭ đĭ amăng rơnŭk arăng yap akŏ mơnuih, laih anŭn ñu iâu mă lu mơnuih ƀing ană plei đuaĭ tui ñu.

And now I say to you, Withdraw from these men and let them alone, for if this counsel or this work have its origin from men, it will be destroyed; @ Tui anŭn amăng tơlơi truh anai, kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih anăm hơduah tơlơi pơkơdơ̆ng hăng ƀing anai ôh.

And they listened to his advice; and having called the apostles, they beat them, and enjoined them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them. @ Tui anŭn, ƀing gơñu gưt tui hiăp Gamaliel laĭ anŭn.

They therefore went their way from [the] presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonoured for the name. @ Tui anŭn ƀing khua ding kơna tơbiă mơ̆ng anih phat kơđi, pran jua bă hăng tơlơi hơ̆k mơak yua kơ Ơi Adai yap kơ gơñu lăp tŭ tơlơi mlâo yua kơ anăn Yêsu. 
And every day, in the temple and in the houses, they ceased not teaching and announcing the glad tidings that Jesus [was] the Christ. @ Laih anŭn rĭm hrơi amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ ƀôdah pơ rĭm boh sang ƀing đaŏ, gơñu ƀu pơdơi ôh pơtô pơhrăm hăng ră ruai Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ tơlơi Yêsu jing Yang Krist.
But in those days, the disciples multiplying in number, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews because their widows were overlooked in the daily ministration. @ Hlăk anŭn mrô ƀing ding kơna đĭ jai lu hloh dơ̆ng, ƀing Hêlênist pơhiăp brŏk kơ ƀing Hêbrơ, yua kơ gơñu ƀu hơdơr ôh kơ ƀing đah kơmơi Hêlênist djai rơkơi amăng tơlơi gơñu pơpha gơnam ƀơ̆ng huă rĭm hrơi. 
And the twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples to [them], said, It is not right that we, leaving the word of God, should serve tables. @ Pluh dua čô khua ding kơna iâu pơƀŭt glaĭ abih bang ƀing ding kơna hăng laĭ: “Lui hĭ bruă pơtô boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai, pŭng kơ mă bruă gơnam ƀơ̆ng huă anŭn jing ƀu gal djơ̆ ôh. 
Look out therefore, brethren, from among yourselves seven men, well reported of, full of [the] [Holy] Spirit and wisdom, whom we will establish over this business: @ Tui anŭn, Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, ruah mă bĕ mơ̆ng amăng ƀing ta tơjuh čô mơnuih hmâo tơlơi hing ang hiam, bă blai Yang Bơngăt Hiam, hmâo tơlơi kơhnâo, laih anŭn ƀing gơmơi či jao brơi bruă anai kơ gơñu.

And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and [the] Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch, @ Abih bang ƀing ding kơna leng kơ mơak kơ tơlơi gơñu kơčĕ anŭn, laih anŭn gơñu hmâo ruah Êtiên pô bă tơlơi đaŏ laih anŭn Yang Bơngăt Hiam, Philip, Prokorus, Nikanor, Timôn, Parmênas, laih anŭn Nikôlas mơnuih plei Antiôs tui tơlơi đaŏ Yuđa. 
whom they set before the apostles; and, having prayed, they laid their hands on them. @ Gơñu pơdah tơjuh čô anŭn kơ ƀing khua ding kơna, giơ̆ng anŭn ƀing khua ding kơna iâu laĭ ah tơngan ƀơi gơñu.
And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was very greatly multiplied, and a great crowd of the priests obeyed the faith. @ Boh Pơhiăp Ơi Adai lar hyu jai lu, laih anŭn ƀing ding kơna pơ plei Yêrusalem jai đĭ lu hloh dơ̆ng.

And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought wonders and great signs among the people. @ Êtiên bă hăng tơlơi pap mơ̆ng Ơi Adai laih anŭn tơlơi dưi mơyang, ngă tơlơi mơsêh mơyang hăng gru kơnăl mơyang tơ̆ng krah ană plei pla. 
And there arose up certain of those of the synagogue called of freedmen, and of Cyrenians, and of Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen. @ Samơ̆ hmâo đơđa ƀing mơnuih amăng sang bơjơnum arăng pơanăn sang jơnum kơ ƀing mơnuih rơngai, laih anŭn plei Siren, ƀing plei Aleksandri, hăng ƀing Yuđa mơ̆ng čar Silisi laih anŭn čar Asi, tơgŭ đĭ pơrơjah hăng Êtiên. 
And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke. @ Samơ̆ gơñu ƀu dưi pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ ôh hăng boh pơhiăp kơhnâo Êtiên, Yang Bơngăt Hiam yơh Pô brơi ñu pơhiăp.

And they roused the people, and the elders, and the scribes. And coming upon [him] they seized him and brought [him] to the council. @ Gơñu pơsur ƀing ană plei, ƀing kŏng tha, hăng ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt. Gơñu rai mă čaŏ Êtiên hăng ba ñu pơ anăp ƀing khua phat kơđi. 
And they set false witnesses, saying, This man does not cease speaking words against the holy place and the law; @ Gơñu brơi mơnuih ngă gơ̆ng jơlan ƀlor, laĭ tui anai: “Pô anai nanao pơhiăp ƀrưh hmiah pơkơdơ̆ng hăng anih rơgoh hiam anai laih anŭn hăng tơlơi juăt Môis.

And all who sat in the council, looking fixedly on him, saw his face as [the] face of an angel. @ Abih bang mơnuih dŏ ber amăng tơlơi phat kơđi anŭn dŏ krĕng lăng kơ Êtiên ƀu ƀleh mơta ôh, ƀuh ƀô̆ mơta ñu hrup kar hăng ƀô̆ mơta ling jang.
And the high priest said, Are these things then so? @ Khua ngă yang prŏng hloh tơña kơ Êtiên: “Djơ̆ sĭt tui anŭn mơ̆?”
And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, @ Êtiên laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, Ơ ƀing ama, dŏ hmư̆ kâo bĕ!

Then going out of the land of the Chaldeans he dwelt in Charran, and thence, after his father died, he removed him into this land in which *ye* now dwell. @ Hlăk anŭn ñu tơbiă mơ̆ng čar Kaldê hăng nao dŏ pơ plei Čaran.

And he did not give him an inheritance in it, not even what his foot could stand on; and promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when he had no child. @ Ơi Adai ƀu brơi kong ngăn hơgĕt kơ ñu ôh amăng čar anŭn, ƀôdah sa pŏk lŏn đơ plă tơkai juă kŏn hmâo lơi, samơ̆ Ơi Adai ƀuăn či brơi čar anŭn jing kong ngăn kơ ñu laih anŭn kơ ƀing ană tơčo ñu tơdơi adih, wơ̆t dah hlăk anŭn Abraham aka hmâo ană ôh. 
And God spoke thus: His seed shall be a sojourner in a strange land, and they shall enslave them and evil entreat [them] four hundred years; @ Ơi Adai laĭ ƀing ană tơčo ñu či jing tuai amăng čar arăng; arăng či mă ƀing gơñu ngă hlŭn hăng kơtư̆ juă gơñu amăng pă rơtuh thŭn.

And he gave to him [the] covenant of circumcision; and thus he begat Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. @ Ơi Adai brơi kơ Abraham kơnol pơgop hăng phĕt khăt klĭ.

And the patriarchs, envying Joseph, sold him away into Egypt. And God was with him, @  Ƀing ơi phŭn anŭn moañ kơ Yôsep, sĭ hĭ ñu pơ čar Êjip. Samơ̆ Ơi Adai dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu,

And when a period of forty years was fulfilled to him, it came into his heart to look upon his brethren, the sons of Israel; @  Hlăk Môis hmâo pă pluh thŭn laih, ñu hmâo tơlơi pơmĭn amăng pran jua ñu kiăng nao čuă ngui ƀing adơi ayŏng ñu, jing ƀing Israel.

For he thought that his brethren would understand that God by his hand was giving them deliverance. But they understood not. @ Ñu mĭn dah adơi ayŏng ñu či thâo hluh Ơi Adai či yua hăng tơngan ñu pơklaih ƀing gơñu, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu thâo hluh ôh. 
And on the morrow he shewed himself to them as they were contending, and compelled them to peace, saying, *Ye* are brethren, why do ye wrong one another? @ Hrơi tơdơi ñu ƀuh dua čô Israel pơrơdjơ̆ pơtaih tơdruă gơñu, Môis nao jĕ kiăng ngă pơrơnom glaĭ hăng laĭ: ‘Hơi, hmư̆ kâo bĕ ƀing gih jing adơi ayŏng hyư̆m kiăng ngă pơrăm tơdruă lĕ?’

And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Madiam, where he begat two sons. @ Tơ hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, Môis đuaĭ dŏp nao dŏ amăng čar Madian. Pơ anŭn ñu hmâo dua čô ană đah rơkơi.

And Moses seeing it wondered at the vision; and as he went up to consider it, there was a voice of [the] Lord, @ Môis ƀuh hăng kơtuă hling hlang kơ anŏ ñu ƀuh anŭn, laih anŭn ñu nao jĕ kiăng lăng rơđah hloh, samơ̆ ñu hmư̆ săp Khua Yang pơhiăp hăng ñu,

This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers; who received living oracles to give to us; @ Môis anai yơh pô dŏ amăng tơ̆ng krah ană plei pla pơtŭm pơ tơdrŏn har hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ling jang, Pô hmâo pơhiăp laih hăng ñu ƀơi čư̆ Sinai, laih anŭn hăng ƀing ơi adon ƀing ta.

And hearing these things they were cut to the heart, and gnashed their teeth against him. @ Tơ gơñu hmư̆ hơdôm tơlơi anŭn, gơñu bă hăng tơlơi hil kơtang, laih anŭn kĕ tơgơi kơ Êtiên. 
But being full of [the] Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes on heaven, he saw [the] glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, @ Samơ̆ Êtiên, bă blai Yang Bơngăt Hiam, angak lăng pơ adai, ƀuh tơlơi ang yang Ơi Adai laih anŭn Yêsu dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi gah hơnuă Ơi Adai.

And they cried out with a loud voice, and held their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord; @ Samơ̆ gơñu ur kraih kơtang, kơđơ̆l hĭ amăng tơngia gơñu, laih anŭn hrŏm hơbĭt gơñu blŭng nao mă Êtiên,

And they stoned Stephen, praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. @ Tơdang gơñu glŏm boh pơtâo kơ Êtiên, Êtiên iâu laĭ tui anai: “Ơ Khua Yang Yêsu, rơkâo kơ Ih tŭ mă bơngăt kâo.” 
And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And having said this, he fell asleep. @ Êtiên tŏ tơŭt hăng ur kraih kơtang: “Ơ Khua Yang, anăm yap tơlơi soh anai kơ ƀing gơñu ôh!” Giơ̆ng ñu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, gơ̆ pĭt yơh.
And Saul was consenting to his being killed. And on that day there arose a great persecution against the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and all were scattered into the countries of Judaea and Samaria except the apostles. @ Sôl ăt tŭ ư mơ̆n amăng tơlơi arăng pơdjai Êtiên.

And pious men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him. @ Ƀing đaŏ kơjăp tŏng ten dơr Êtiên hăng čŏk hia rơngot biă mă kơ gơ̆. 
But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into the houses one after another, and dragging off both men and women delivered them up to prison. @ Bơ Sôl phara hơjăn ñu, ñu sem hơduah pơrai Phung Sang Ơi Adai, mŭt rĭm boh sang mă čaŏ ƀing đah rơkơi, đah kơmơi hăng ba krư̆ ƀing gơ̆ amăng sang mơnă.
Those then that had been scattered went through [the countries] announcing the glad tidings of the word. @ Tui anŭn, hơdôm ƀing mơnuih čơlah bra hyu tar ƀar anih gơñu pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam. 
And Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, preached the Christ to them; @ Philip trŭn nao pơ sa boh plei amăng tring Samari, ră ruai Yang Krist kơ ƀing gơñu. 
and the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, when they heard [him] and saw the signs which he wrought. @ Ƀing mơnuih lu hmư̆ tơlơi Philip pơtô hăng ƀuh gru kơnăl mơyang ñu ngă. Tui anŭn gơñu sa pran jua dŏ kơčăng hmư̆ ñu. 
For from many who had unclean spirits they went out, crying with a loud voice; and many that were paralysed and lame were healed. @ Lu yang bơngăt grĭ hơƀak ur kraih tơbiă mơ̆ng lu mơnuih gơñu hmâo ngă; laih anŭn hmâo lu ƀing mơnuih rơwen hăng jo ăt suaih mơ̆n. 
And there was great joy in that city. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh amăng tring Samari hmâo tơlơi mơak mơai biă mă.
But a certain man, by name Simon, had been before in the city, using magic arts, and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying that himself was some great one. @ Hlăk anŭn amăng plei anŭn hmâo sa čô đah rơkơi anăn ñu Simôn, hlâo adih ngă bruă pơjâu mơnăn laih anŭn ngă brơi ană plei pla Samari kơtuă hling, pơang ñu pô jing sa čô hing ang prŏng.

But when they believed Philip announcing the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women. @ Samơ̆ tơ gơñu đaŏ kơ tơlơi Philip, mơnuih pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai laih anŭn anăn Khua Yang Yêsu Krist kơ ƀing gơñu, abih bang ƀing gơñu đah rơkơi wơ̆t đah kơmơi tŭ ƀatem. 
And Simon also himself believed; and, having been baptised, continued constantly with Philip; and, beholding the signs and great works of power which took place, was astonished. @ Wơ̆t Simôn pô ăt đaŏ kar kaĭ mơ̆n.

And the apostles who were in Jerusalem, having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and John; @ Tơ ƀing khua ding kơna dŏ pơ plei Yêrusalem hmư̆ hing kơ ƀing Samari hmâo mă tŭ boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai, gơñu pơkiaŏ nao Pêtrôs hăng Yôhan nao pơ gơñu. 
who, having come down, prayed for them that they might receive [the] Holy Spirit; @ Tơ dua gơñu truh pơ anŭn laih, gơñu iâu laĭ brơi kơ ƀing mơnuih đaŏ anŭn kiăng kơ gơñu mă tŭ Yang Bơngăt Hiam;

But Simon, having seen that by the laying on of the hands of the apostles the [Holy] Spirit was given, offered them money, @ Tơ Simôn ƀuh Ơi Adai brơi Yang Bơngăt Hiam yua mơ̆ng ƀing khua ding kơna ah tơngan, ñu pơyơr prăk kơ gơñu hăng laĭ,

And Peter said to him, Thy money go with thee to destruction, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be obtained by money. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs laĭ glaĭ: “Prăk ih răm rai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ih, yua kơ ih pơmĭn dưi blơi tơlơi Ơi Adai pha brơi hăng prăk mah!

Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and supplicate the Lord, if indeed the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee; @ Tui anŭn kơhmal hĭ bĕ tơlơi soh sat ih anai, hăng iâu laĭ kơ Khua Yang, kiăng kơ tơlơi pơmĭn pran jua ih năng ai či hmâo tơlơi pap brơi mơ̆n thâo.

And Simon answering said, Supplicate *ye* for me to the Lord, so that nothing may come upon me of the things of which ye have spoken. @ Simôn laĭ glaĭ: “Rơkâo kơ ƀing gih iâu laĭ kơ Khua Yang brơi kơ kâo, kiăng kơ tơlơi ƀing gih hmâo laĭ anŭn ƀu lĕ kơ kâo ôh.”
They therefore, having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and announced the glad tidings to many villages of the Samaritans. @ Giơ̆ng kơ Pêtrôs hăng Yôhan hmâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơklă tơlơi đaŏ hăng pơtô laĭ boh pơhiăp Khua Yang, gơñu glaĭ pơ plei Yêrusalem, gơñu rơbat rah, ră ruai pơtô rah Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam amăng lu boh plei ƀing mơnuih Samari.
But [the] angel of [the] Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise up and go southward on the way which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza: the same is desert. @ Hlăk anŭn sa čô ling jang Khua Yang laĭ kơ Philip: “Tơgŭ bĕ hăng nao pơ gah dơnŭng ƀơi jơlan mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem trŭn nao pơ plei Gasa.” Jơlan anŭn hyăl amal biă mă.

And the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot. @ Yang Bơngăt Hiam laĭ kơ Philip: “Đuaĭ tui hơmao rơdeh aseh anŭn hăng nao jĕ bĕ.” 
And Philip, running up, heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and said, Dost thou then know what thou art reading of? @ Tui anŭn Philip đuaĭ nao pơ ñu, laih anŭn hmư̆ ñu dŏ đŏk hơdrôm hră pô laĭ lui hlâo Êsai, Philip tơña kơ ñu: “Ih thâo hluh mơ̆ tơlơi ih hlăk dŏ đŏk anŭn?”

And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man how much evil he has done to thy saints at Jerusalem; @ Samơ̆ Ananias laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang, kâo hmâo hmư̆ lu mơnuih laĭ djơ̆ kơ pô anai hmâo ngă sat kơ ƀing rơgoh hiam Ih pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name. @ Ră anai ñu dŏ pơ anai, hmâo abih tơlơi dưi mơ̆ng ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng jao brơi kiăng mă čaŏ hĭ abih ƀing iâu laĭ kơ anăn Ih.”
And the Lord said to him, Go, for this [man] is an elect vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and [the] sons of Israel: @ Samơ̆ Khua Yang laĭ: “Nao bĕ, yua kơ ñu jing pô Kâo hmâo ruah laih kiăng yua ñu pơhaih anăn Kâo ƀơi anăp ƀing djuai tuai, ƀing pơtao, laih anŭn ƀing ană Israel.

And Ananias went and entered into the house; and laying his hands upon him he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me, Jesus that appeared to thee in the way in which thou camest, that thou mightest see, and be filled with [the] Holy Spirit. @ Tui anŭn Ananias tơbiă nao hăng mŭt amăng sang, ñu ah tơngan ƀơi Sôl hăng laĭ: “Ơ ayŏng Sôl, Khua Yang Yêsu Pô hmâo pơƀuh laih kơ ih ƀơi rŏk jơlan ih rai, hmâo pơkiaŏ kâo kiăng kơ mơta ih dưi ƀuh glaĭ dơ̆ng laih anŭn bă blai hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam.” 
And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he saw, and rising up was baptised; @ Tañ mơtam, hmâo sa mơnơ̆ng kar hăng kơmoh akan lĕ hĭ mơ̆ng mơta Sôl, laih anŭn mơta ñu rơđah glaĭ yơh. Ñu tơgŭ hăng tŭ ƀatem.

And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that *he* is the Son of God. @ Ñu čơdơ̆ng pơtô mơtam amăng sang bơjơnum pơhaih Yêsu jing Ană Ơi Adai.
And all who heard were astonished and said, Is not this *he* who destroyed in Jerusalem those who called on this name, and here was come for this purpose, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests? @ Abih bang ƀing hmư̆ ñu, gơñu leng kơtuă hling biă mă hăng laĭ: “Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă mơnuih anai jing pô hmâo ngă sat laih kơ ƀing iâu laĭ kơ anăn anai pơ plei Yêrusalem, laih anŭn ñu hmâo rai pơ anai kiăng mă čaŏ ƀing đaŏ dui ba pơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng?”
But Saul increased the more in power, and confounded the Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ. @ Samơ̆ Sôl jai kơjăp kơtang hloh dơ̆ng, pơrơjah pơgăl hăng ƀing ană Yuđa dŏ pơ plei Damas hăng ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơklă tơlơi Yêsu jing Yang Krist.
Now when many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted together to kill him. @  Rơgao sui hrơi mơ̆ng anŭn, ƀing ană Yuđa dưm tơlơi mơneč kiăng pơdjai ñu. 
But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched also the gates both day and night, that they might kill him; @ Samơ̆ hmâo mơnuih nao laĭ pơthâo hĭ Sôl kơ tơlơi mơneč gơñu anŭn. Hrơi mlam gơñu dŏ krăp ƀơi amăng jang kiăng pơdjai Sôl.

And having arrived at Jerusalem he essayed to join himself to the disciples, and all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple. @ Tơ truh pơ plei Yêrusalem ñu kiăng nao bưp ƀing ding kơna pơkŏn; samơ̆ abih bang gơñu leng kơ hwĭ kơ ñu, yua kơ ƀing gơñu ƀu đaŏ ôh kơ ñu jing ding kơna sĭt. 
But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus. @ Tui anŭn, Barnabas nao djru hăng ba nao ñu pơ ƀing khua ding kơna, laih anŭn ră ruai brơi kơ ƀing gơñu kơ tơlơi Sôl hmâo ƀuh Khua Yang ƀơi rŏk jơlan, tơlơi Khua Yang hmâo pơhiăp laih kơ Sôl, laih anŭn hyư̆m Sôl hmâo pơtô laih anăn Yêsu hăng tơlơi khĭn amăng plei Damas.

The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the Holy Spirit. @ Tui anŭn, abih Phung Sang Ơi Adai amăng tring Yuđa, tring Galilê hăng tring Samari hmâo tơlơi rơnŭk rơnua, prŏng đĭ tui; Phung Sang Ơi Adai rơbat amăng tơlơi hwĭ pơpŭ kơ Khua Yang laih anŭn mơ̆ng tơlơi Yang Bơngăt Hiam djru, hmâo mơnuih đaŏ thim lu jai.
Now it came to pass that Peter, passing through all [quarters], descended also to the saints who inhabited Lydda. @ Tơdang Pêtrôs hyu djŏp djang anih, ñu ăt trŭn nao mơ̆n pơ ƀing rơgoh hiam pơ plei Lida. 
And he found there a certain man, Aeneas by name, who had been lying for eight years upon a couch, who was paralysed. @ Pơ anŭn Pêtrôs ƀuh sa čô mơnuih rơwen anăn gơ̆ Ênê; dŏ đih ƀơi sưng hmâo sapăn thŭn laih. 
And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus, the Christ, heals thee: rise up, and make thy couch for thyself. And straightway he rose up. @ Pêtrôs laĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ Ênê, Yêsu Krist pơsuaih brơi ih; tơgŭ bĕ hăng rơmet sưng pĭt ih.” Gơ̆ tơgŭ mơtam. 
And all who inhabited Lydda and the Saron saw him, who turned to the Lord. @ Abih bang ƀing amăng plei Lida hăng plei Sarôn ƀuh gơ̆, laih anŭn gơñu leng kơ wơ̆t glaĭ kơ Khua Yang.
And in Joppa there was a certain female disciple, by name Tabitha, which being interpreted means Dorcas. She was full of good works and alms-deeds which she did. @ Pơ plei Jôpa hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi ding kơna anăn ñu HʼTabitha, arăng iâu dơ̆ng HʼDôrkas (kiăng laĭ kơtŏng).

And it came to pass in those days that she grew sick and died; and, having washed her, they put her in [the] upper room. @ Hlăk anŭn ñu ruă laih anŭn djai hĭ. Arăng rao drơi jan gơ̆ hăng pơđih hĭ pơ adŭ tal glong. 
But Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter was there, sent two men to him, beseeching him, Thou must not delay coming to us. @ Yua kơ plei Lida jĕ hăng plei Jôpa, ƀing ding kơna hmư̆ kơ Pêtrôs dŏ pơ anŭn, laih anŭn pơkiaŏ dua čô đah rơkơi nao laĭ kơ ñu: “Rơkâo kơ ih rai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơmơi tañ mơtam.” 
And Peter rising up went with them, whom, when arrived, they brought up into the upper chamber; and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing him the body-coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. @ Tui anŭn Pêtrôs tơgŭ nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing anŭn.

But Peter, putting them all out, and kneeling down, prayed. And, turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up. @ Pêtrôs pơtă abih bang mơnuih tơbiă pơ gah rơngiao.

And having given her [his] hand, he raised her up, and having called the saints and the widows, presented her living. @ Pêtrôs yơr tơngan rŭ gơ̆ tơgŭ; hăng iâu ƀing rơgoh hiam hăng ƀing đah kơmơi djai rơkơi brơi gơñu ƀuh gơ̆ dŏ hơdip. 
And it became known throughout the whole of Joppa, and many believed on the Lord. @ Bruă anŭn arăng hmư̆ hing hyu amăng abih plei Jôpa, laih anŭn lu mơnuih đaŏ kơ Khua Yang. 
And it came to pass that he remained many days in Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner. @ Pêtrôs dŏ glaĭ pơ plei Jôpa lu hrơi amăng sang Simôn, sa čô mơnuih ngă bruă lok klĭ.
But a certain man in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italic, @ Amăng plei Sêsarê hmâo sa čô mơnuih anăn ñu Kôrnai, ngă khua kơ sa rơtuh čô ƀing tơhan Itali.

But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God. @ Hăng tơlơi hwĭ tơtư̆ ñu lăng pơñen ling jang hăng laĭ: “Ơ Khua, hmâo tơlơi hơgĕt?” Ling jang laĭ kơ ñu: “Tơlơi ih iâu laĭ laih anŭn mơnơ̆ng ih brơi pap hmâo đĭ truh pơ Ơi Adai laih yơh, laih anŭn Ơi Adai hơdơr pioh tơlơi anŭn. 
And now send men to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter. @ Ră anai pơkiaŏ nao bĕ mơnuih pơ Jôpa iâu Simôn arăng pơanăn Pêtrôs. 
He lodges with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. @ Ñu hlăk dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Simôn, sa čô mơnuih ngă bruă lok klĭ, sang ñu ƀơi hang ia rơsĭ.” 
And when the angel who was speaking to him had departed, having called two of his household and a pious soldier of those who were constantly with him, @ Tơ ling jang pơhiăp hăng ñu đuaĭ hĭ laih, Kôrnai iâu dua čô ding kơna ñu hăng sa čô tơhan hmâo tơlơi đaŏ amăng ƀing tơhan mă bruă kơ ñu.

And on the morrow, as these were journeying and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the house to pray, about the sixth hour. @ Tơdơi kơ hrơi anŭn, tơdang gơñu nao giăm truh pơ plei Jôpa, hlăk yang hrơi dơ̆ng Pêtrôs đĭ pơ bơbŭng sang kiăng iâu laĭ.

And as Peter doubted in himself what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold also the men who were sent by Cornelius, having sought out the house of Simon, stood at the gate, @ Tơdang Pêtrôs rŭng răng dŏ pơmĭn kơ hơgĕt tơlơi pơƀuh anŭn kiăng pia, ƀing mơnuih Kôrnai pơkiaŏ nao hmâo tơña ƀuh sang Simôn laih, laih anŭn gơñu hlăk dŏ ƀơi amăng jang.

And Peter going down to the men said, Behold, *I* am he whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye come? @ Tui anŭn Pêtrôs trŭn nao pơ ƀing mơnuih anŭn hăng laĭ: “Kâo gơ̆ yơh pô ƀing gih sem. Hơgĕt bruă ƀing gih rai?”
And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man, and fearing God, and borne witness to by the whole nation of the Jews, has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for thee to his house, and hear words from thee. @ Gơñu laĭ: “Kôrnai sa čô khua tơhan kơ sa rơtuh čô, sa čô tơpă hiam hăng hwĭ pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai, pô abih bang ƀing ană plei pla Yuđa pơpŭ leng kơ ngă gơ̆ng jơlan hiam.

Having therefore invited them in, he lodged them. And on the morrow, rising up he went away with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa went with him. @ Tui anŭn Pêtrôs iâu gơñu mŭt amăng sang, brơi gơñu đih đơ̆m glaĭ pơ anŭn.

And he said to them, *Ye* know how it is unlawful for a Jew to be joined or come to one of a strange race, and to *me* God has shewn to call no man common or unclean. @ Pêtrôs pơhiăp hăng gơñu: “Ƀing gih pô thâo laih ƀing ană Yuđa ƀu phiăn lir pơgop ƀôdah čuă ngui hăng sa čô mơnuih tuai ôh.

And the faithful of the circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that upon the nations also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out: @ Ƀing đaŏ hmâo tŭ laih tơlơi khăt klĭ, jing ƀing rai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Pêtrôs, dŏ kơtuă hling, yua kơ tơlơi pha brơi Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ơi Adai ăt tuh brơi wơ̆t kơ ƀing djuai tuai mơ̆n. 
for they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered, @ Yua kơ gơñu hmư̆ ƀing anŭn pơhiăp tơlơi tuai laih anŭn bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai. Hlăk anŭn Pêtrôs laĭ, 
Can any one forbid water that these should not be baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also [did]? @ “Hlơi dưi hơngah hĭ tơlơi ƀatem hăng ia kơ ƀing ană plei hmâo mă tŭ laih Yang Bơngăt Hiam kar hăng ƀing ta mơ̆?” 
And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord. Then they begged him to stay some days. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Pêtrôs pơtă brơi gơñu tŭ tơlơi ƀatem amăng anăn Yêsu Krist. Laih anŭn gơñu rơkâo kơ Pêtrôs dŏ glaĭ hăng gơñu ƀiă hrơi dơ̆ng.
And the apostles and the brethren who were in Judaea heard that the nations also had received the word of God; @ Ƀing khua ding kơna hăng ƀing adơi ayŏng amăng tring Yuđa hmư̆ hing ƀing djuai tuai ăt mă tŭ boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai mơ̆n. 
and when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision contended with him, @ Tui anŭn tơ Pêtrôs đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem, ƀing đaŏ amăng ƀing khăt klĭ ƀuah kơčrâo kơ ñu, 
saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and hast eaten with them. @ hăng laĭ: “Hyư̆m ih mŭt amăng sang ƀing mơnuih ƀu khăt klĭ laih anŭn ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hăng gơñu?” 
But Peter began and set forth [the matter] to them in order, saying, @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs čơdơ̆ng pơblang kơ gơñu djơ̆ tui rĭm tal abih bruă hmâo truh laih: 
I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in an ecstasy I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending like a great sheet, let down by four corners out of heaven, and it came even to me: @ “Tơdang kâo dŏ iâu laĭ amăng plei Jôpa, kâo djai huăt laih anŭn hmâo tơlơi pơƀuh. Hmâo mơnơ̆ng kar hăng sa blah khăn prŏng akă hĭ pă akiăng pơtrŭn rai mơ̆ng adai laih anŭn truh pơ kâo. 
on which having fixed mine eyes, I considered, and saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the heaven. @ Tơdang kâo dŏ kơsem lăng ten, kâo ƀuh amăng anŭn hmâo khul hlô mơnơ̆ng pă ƀĕ tơkai, khul hlô glai, khul hlô mơnơ̆ng hro rui, laih anŭn khul čĭm brĭm amăng adai. 
And I heard also a voice saying to me, Rise up, Peter, slay and eat. @ Kâo hmư̆ asăp pơhiăp laĭ kơ kâo: ‘Ơ Pêtrôs, tơgŭ hăng mă čuh ƀơ̆ng bĕ!’ 
And I said, In no wise, Lord, for common or unclean has never entered into my mouth. @ Samơ̆ Kâo laĭ: ‘Ơ Khua Yang, ƀu dưi ôh; yua kơ khul mơnơ̆ng hơgĕt grĭ grañ ƀôdah ƀu rơgoh ƀu dưi mŭt amăng bah kâo ôh.’ 
And a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common. @ Samơ̆ asăp mơ̆ng adai anŭn pơhiăp kơ kâo dơ̆ng tal dua: ‘Hơgĕt mơnơ̆ng Ơi Adai hmâo pơrơgoh laih, anăm ih yap ñu grĭ grañ ôh.’ 
And this took place thrice, and again all was drawn up into heaven; @ Tơlơi anŭn truh klâo wơ̆t, laih anŭn abih bang mơnơ̆ng anŭn dui glaĭ hĭ pơ adai adih. 
and lo, immediately three men were at the house in which I was, sent to me from Caesarea. @ Hlăk anŭn mơtam klâo čô mơnuih arăng pơkiaŏ rai pơ kâo mơ̆ng plei Sêsarê truh ƀơi bah amăng sang kâo dŏ. 
And the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting. And there went with me these six brethren also, and we entered into the house of the man, @ Yang Bơngăt Hiam laĭ kơ kâo brơi kâo nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu anăm dŏ kĭ kơ̆ ôh. Ƀing năm čô adơi ayŏng anai ăt nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng kâo mơ̆n, laih anŭn gơmơi mŭt amăng sang Kôrnai. 
and he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house, standing and saying [to him], Send [men] to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter, @ Kôrnai ră ruai glaĭ kơ gơmơi ñu hmâo ƀuh sa čô ling jang Ơi Adai dŏ dơ̆ng amăng sang ñu hăng laĭ: ‘pơkiaŏ nao bĕ mơnuih pơ plei Jôpa, iâu Simôn arăng pơanăn Pêtrôs.

And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them even as upon us also at the beginning. @ Tơ kâo čơdơ̆ng pơhiăp, Yang Bơngăt Hiam trŭn ƀơi ƀing gơñu hrup hăng Ñu hmâo trŭn ƀơi ƀing ta hlăk blŭng hlâo. 
And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with [the] Holy Spirit. @ Tui anŭn kâo hơdơr boh pơhiăp Khua Yang hmâo laĭ: ‘Yôhan hmâo ngă ƀatem ƀing gih hăng ia, samơ̆ ƀing gih či tŭ ƀatem hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam.’ 
If then God has given them the same gift as also to us when we had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who indeed was *I* to be able to forbid God? @ Tui anŭn, tơdah Ơi Adai ăt brơi laih kơ gơñu gơnam brơi kar hăng Ñu hmâo brơi laih kơ ƀing ta hlăk ƀing ta đaŏ kơ Khua Yang Yêsu Krist, hlơi kâo jing tơl kâo khĭn čơgăn hĭ Ơi Adai?” 
And when they heard these things they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then indeed God has to the nations also granted repentance to life. @ Tơ ƀing ƀuah kơ Pêtrôs hmâo hmư̆ tơlơi anŭn, gơñu dŏ rơiăt, laih anŭn pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai, hăng laĭ: “Tui anŭn Ơi Adai ăt brơi mơ̆n kơ ƀing djuai tuai tơlơi kơhmal kơ tơlơi soh kiăng hmâo tơlơi hơdip.”
They then who had been scattered abroad through the tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen, passed through [the country] to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone. @  Hmâo đơđa ƀing đaŏ čơlah bra hyu yua kơ tơlơi arăng ngă sat, mơ̆ng tơlơi arăng pơdjai Êtiên anŭn, gơñu nao truh pơ čar Phênisi, ƀơi plao ia Čiprơ, laih anŭn pơ Antiôs, pơtô tơlơi Ơi Adai pơhiăp kơnơ̆ng kơ ƀing ană Yuđa đôč. 
But there were certain of them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who entering into Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, announcing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus. @ Samơ̆ hmâo đơđa amăng ƀing anŭn mơ̆ng plao ia Čiprơ laih anŭn Siren nao pơ Antiôs, gơñu ăt pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ ƀing mơnuih Grek mơ̆n, Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam Khua Yang Yêsu. 
And [the] Lord's hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord. @ Tơngan Khua Yang dŏ hrŏm hăng gơñu, laih anŭn hmâo lu mơnuih đaŏ kơ Khua Yang. 
And the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go through as far as Antioch: @ Hmư̆ tơlơi pơthâo anŭn, Phung Sang Ơi Adai pơ plei Yêrusalem mơit nao Barnabas pơ Antiôs. 
who, having arrived and seeing the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord; @ Tơ ñu truh pơ anŭn ƀuh tơlơi pap Ơi Adai ñu mơak biă mă; ñu pơalum pơtrŭt abih bang gơñu brơi dŏ kơjăp, hăng abih pran jua đuaĭ tui Khua Yang. 
for he was a good man and full of [the] Holy Spirit and of faith; and a large crowd [of people] were added to the Lord. @ Yua kơ Barnabas jing mơnuih hiam klă, bă blai Yang Bơngăt Hiam, laih anŭn tơlơi đaŏ. Hmâo lu mơnuih đaŏ kơ Khua Yang. 
And he went away to Tarsus to seek out Saul. @ Giơ̆ng kơ anŭn Barnabas nao pơ plei Tars kiăng hơduah sem Sôl. 
And having found [him], he brought him to Antioch. And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. @ Tơ ñu ƀuh laih Sôl, ñu ba Sôl pơ Antiôs. Abih amăng sa thŭn gơñu jơnum hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Phung Sang Ơi Adai, laih anŭn pơhrăm lu mơnuih. Blŭng hlâo amăng plei Antiôs anai yơh arăng pơphŭn iâu ƀing ding kơna jing mơnuih Krist.
Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch; @ Amăng khul hrơi anŭn hmâo ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo trŭn mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem nao pơ plei Antiôs. 
and one from among them, by name Agabus, rose up and signified by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine over all the inhabited earth, which also came to pass under Claudius. @ Sa čô amăng ƀing gơñu, anăn gơ̆ Agabus, mơ̆ng tơlơi dưi mơyang Yang Bơngăt Hiam brơi ñu laĭ pơthâo hlâo či hmâo tơlơi ư̆ rơpa prŏng tar ƀar lŏn tơnah. Tơlơi ư̆ rơpa anŭn truh sĭt amăng rơnŭk pơtao Klôd wai lăng. 
And they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea, to minister [to them]; @ Ƀing ding kơna khư̆p ư mơit mơnơ̆ng djru kơ ƀing adơi ayŏng dŏ amăng tring Yuđa, tui hăng rĭm čô pô ñu dưi. 
which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. @ Gơñu ngă bruă anŭn laih anŭn mơit mơnơ̆ng djru kơ ƀing kŏng tha mơ̆ng tơngan Barnabas hăng Sôl.
At that time Herod the king laid his hands on some of those of the assembly to do them hurt, @ Hlăk anŭn pơtao Hêrôt čơdơ̆ng ngă sat kơ đơđa mơnuih amăng Phung Sang Ơi Adai. 
and slew James, the brother of John, with the sword. @ Pơtao yua đao pơdjai hĭ Yakơ ayŏng Yôhan. 
And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he went on to take Peter also: (and they were the days of unleavened bread:) @ Tơ ñu ƀuh tơlơi anŭn ngă mơak kơ ƀing Yuđa, kar kaĭ mơ̆n ñu brơi arăng mă čaŏ Pêtrôs dơ̆ng. Tơlơi anŭn truh hlăk phĕt Ƀañ Tơpŭng Ƀu Hmâo Tơpơi. 
whom having seized he put in prison, having delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep, purposing after the passover to bring him out to the people. @ Tơ mă čaŏ laih Pêtrôs, ñu brơi krư̆ hĭ gơ̆ amăng sang mơnă, jao ñu kơ pă khul tơhan gak wai, rĭm khul hmâo pă čô tơhan. Ñu pơmĭn giơ̆ng kơ hrơi phĕt Tơlơi Găn ñu či ba gơ̆ ƀơi anăp ană plei pla. 
Peter therefore was kept in the prison; but unceasing prayer was made by the assembly to God concerning him. @ Tui anŭn arăng krư̆ hĭ Pêtrôs amăng sang mơnă, samơ̆ Phung Sang Ơi Adai dŏ iâu laĭ kơ Ơi Adai brơi kơ ñu hăng abih pran jua.
And when Herod was going to bring him forth, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards before the door kept the prison. @ Mlam hlâo kơ hrơi pơtao Hêrôt kiăng ba gơ̆ pơ anăp ƀing ană plei pla, Pêtrôs dŏ pĭt ƀơi tơ̆ng krah dua čô tơhan, arăng akă hăng dua ară hrĕ čuăk; laih anŭn hmâo tơhan dŏ gak ƀơi anăp bah amăng sang mơnă. 
And lo, an angel of [the] Lord came there, and a light shone in the prison: and having smitten the side of Peter, he roused him up, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off his hands. @ Plŭt mơtam, sa čô ling jang Khua Yang rai, laih anŭn hmâo tơlơi bơngač pơčrang amăng sang mơnă. Ling jang taih ƀơi djeo Pêtrôs, râo ñu hăng laĭ: “Tơgŭ tañ bĕ!” Laih anŭn hrĕ čuăk tơgloh mơ̆ng tơngan ñu lĕ trŭn hĭ. 
And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Cast thine upper garment about thee and follow me. @ Ling jang laĭ kơ ñu: “Hrăng hơdrăng kơiăng bĕ hăng čŭt klĭ juă ih bĕ.” Pêtrôs ngă tui anŭn. Ling jang laĭ dơ̆ng: “Buh ao phyung ih bĕ hăng đuaĭ tui kâo.” 
And going forth he followed [him] and did not know that what was happening by means of the angel was real, but supposed he saw a vision. @ Pêtrôs tơbiă hăng đuaĭ tui ñu. Ñu ƀu thâo ôh tơlơi ling jang ngă anŭn jing sĭt, samơ̆ ñu mĭn dah ñu hmâo tơlơi pơƀuh đôč. 
And having passed through a first and second guard, they came to the iron gate which leads into the city, which opened to them of itself; and going forth they went down one street, and immediately the angel left him. @ Tơ gơñu găn laih ƀing tơhan gak wai tal blŭng laih anŭn tal dua, gơñu truh pơ amăng jang pơsơi ƀơi jơlan nao pơ plei prŏng.

And Peter, being come to himself, said, Now I know certainly that [the] Lord has sent forth his angel and has taken me out of the hand of Herod and all the expectation of the people of the Jews. @ Amlư̆ Pêtrôs thâo hluh tơlơi truh kơ ñu, hăng laĭ: “Ră anai kâo thâo sĭt Khua Yang pơkiaŏ rai ling jang ñu pơklaih kâo mơ̆ng tơngan pơtao Hêrôt laih anŭn mơ̆ng abih tơlơi ƀing Yuđa dŏ čang rơmang.”
And having become clearly conscious [in himself], he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was surnamed Mark, where were many gathered together and praying. @ Giơ̆ng kơ ñu dŏ pơmĭn tơlơi anŭn, ñu nao pơ sang HʼMari amĭ Yôhan pơanăn dơ̆ng Markôs. Pơ anŭn hmâo lu mơnuih dŏ pơtŭm hơbĭt iâu laĭ. 
And when he had knocked at the door of the entry, a maid came to listen, by name Rhoda; @ Pêtrôs khŏk bah amăng jang, sa čô ding kơna đah kơmơi anăn ñu HʼRôda tơbiă nao lăng. 
and having recognised the voice of Peter, through joy did not open the entry, but running in, reported that Peter was standing before the entry. @ Gơ̆ thâo krăn asăp Pêtrôs, ñu hơ̆k mơak đơi tơl ñu ƀu pŏk bah amăng ôh, samơ̆ ñu mŭt glaĭ laĭ pơthâo kơ arăng Pêtrôs dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi bah amăng jang. 
And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she maintained that it was so. And they said, It is his angel. @ Gơñu laĭ: “Ih hưt hă!” Samơ̆ gơ̆ khŭt khăt anŭn jing sĭt. Gơñu laĭ: “Anŭn năng ai ling jang ñu.” 
But Peter continued knocking: and having opened, they saw him and were astonished. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs ăt dŏ khŏk nanao bah amăng. Tơ gơñu pŏk hĭ bah amăng laih, ƀuh Pêtrôs gơñu hwĭ kơtuă hling biă mă. 
And having made a sign to them with his hand to be silent, he related [to them] how the Lord had brought him out of prison; and he said, Report these things to James and to the brethren. And he went out and went to another place. @ Samơ̆ Pêtrôs yơr tơngan ngă gru brơi gơñu dŏ rơiăt, giơ̆ng anŭn Pêtrôs ruai glaĭ kơ gơñu hyư̆m tơlơi Khua Yang hmâo pơklaih ñu mơ̆ng sang mơnă.

And when it was day there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, what then was become of Peter. @ Tơ truh mơguah, hmâo tơlơi rŭng răng prŏng tơ̆ng krah ƀing tơhan, yua kơ gơñu ƀu thâo ôh hơgĕt tơlơi hmâo truh laih kơ Pêtrôs. 
And Herod having sought him and not found him, having examined the guards, commanded [them] to be executed. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea and stayed [there]. @ Pơtao Hêrôt pơtă mơnuih hyu sem, samơ̆ ƀu dưi ƀuh Pêtrôs ôh, ñu tơña kơsem kơ ƀing tơhan gak wai, giơ̆ng anŭn pơtă brơi arăng pơdjai hĭ ƀing gơñu.

And he was in bitter hostility with [the] Tyrians and Sidonians; but they came to him with one accord, and, having gained Blastus the king's chamberlain, sought peace, because their country was nourished by the king's. @ Pơtao Hêrôt hil kơ djuai mơnuih Tir hăng Sidôn; tui anŭn, gơñu sa pran jua nao bưp pơtao.

And on a set day, clothed in royal apparel and sitting on the elevated seat [of honour], Herod made a public oration to them. @ Truh hrơi hmâo pơkơčah laih, pơtao Hêrôt buh sum ao pơtao, dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao, laih anŭn hmâo tơlơi pơhiăp pơtă hăng gơñu. 
And the people cried out, A god's voice and not a man's. @ Ƀing ană plei ur kraih hăng laĭ: “Anai jing asăp yang pơhiăp, ƀu djơ̆ asăp mơnuih ôh!” 
And immediately an angel of [the] Lord smote him, because he did not give the glory to God, and he expired, eaten of worms. @ Ƀơi mông anŭn mơtam sa čô ling jang Khua Yang taih pơtao Hêrôt, yua kơ ñu ƀu brơi tơlơi ang yang kơ Ơi Adai ôh, laih anŭn hlăt čeo ƀơ̆ng hĭ ñu tơl djai.
But the word of God grew and spread itself. @ Hlăk anŭn boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai arăng hmư̆ hyu tar ƀar ƀrư̆ hrơi jai lu biă mă.
And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having fulfilled the service [entrusted to them], taking also with them John, surnamed Mark. @ Giơ̆ng kơ Barnabas hăng Sôl ngă laih bruă hmâo jao kơ gơñu, gơñu mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem, wơ̆t glaĭ pơ Antiôs, jak ba Yôhan pô arăng pơanăn Markôs.
Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was [there], prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. @ Amăng Phung Sang Ơi Adai pơ Plei Antiôs hmâo ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo, ƀing nai pơtô: Barnabas, Simêôn, pơanăn Niger, Lusius mơnuih čar Siren, Manahen jing adơi rong pơtao Hêrôt, laih anŭn Sôl. 
And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. @ Tơdang gơñu dŏ kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Khua Yang hăng ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă, Yang Bơngăt Hiam pơhiăp hăng gơñu; “Pioh brơi bĕ Barnabas hăng Sôl kơ bruă Kâo hmâo iâu gơñu.”
Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid [their] hands on them, they let [them] go. @ Giơ̆ng kơ gơñu ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă hăng iâu laĭ, gơñu ah tơngan ƀơi dua gơñu laih anŭn pơkiaŏ nao.

And being in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also as [their] attendant. @ Tơ gơñu truh laih pơ plei Salamin, gơñu pơtô boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai amăng abih bang sang bơjơnum ƀing Yuđa; ăt hmâo mơ̆n Yôhan Markôs djru bruă gơñu.
And having passed through the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a certain man a magician, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus, @ Gơñu găn abih plao ia truh pơ plei Paphôs, gơñu bưp sa čô pơjâu, sa čô Yuđa jing pô laĭ lui hlâo ƀlor anăn ñu Bar Yêsu. 
who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. *He*, having called Barnabas and Saul to [him], desired to hear the word of God. @ Ñu dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng khua čar anăn ñu Serjus Pôlus, sa čô mơnuih kơhnâo.

But Elymas the magician (for so his name is by interpretation) opposed them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith. @ Samơ̆ pô pơjâu anŭn, anăn ñu amăng tơlơi Grek jing Êlimas, pơkơdơ̆ng hăng dua gơñu, hơduah lu jơlan khă čơgăn khua čar anŭn đaŏ.

And now behold, [the] Lord's hand [is] upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and going about he sought persons who should lead him by the hand. @ Lăng bĕ ră anai mơtam, tơngan Khua Yang ngă kơ ih, laih anŭn ih či bum mơta ƀu ƀuh tơlơi bơngač ôh amăng ƀiă hrơi.” Tañ mơtam tơlơi bum mơmŏt tĭt truh kơ Êlimas, laih anŭn ñu wir wư hyu hơduah mơnuih djă tơngan dui ba ñu.

And as they went out they begged that these words might be spoken to them the ensuing sabbath. @ Tơdang Pôl hăng Barnabas tơbiă mơ̆ng sang bơjơnum, ƀing ană plei kơwưh rơkâo kơ gơñu pơtô tơlơi anŭn dơ̆ng ƀơi hrơi Saƀat tơdơi. 
And the congregation of the synagogue having broken up, many of the Jews and of the worshipping proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. @ Tơ tơlơi bơjơnum giơ̆ng hĭ laih, lu ƀing Yuđa hăng ƀing djuai tuai tui tơlơi đaŏ Yuđa, gơñu đuaĭ tui Pôl hăng Barnabas.

But the Jews, seeing the crowds, were filled with envy, and contradicted the things said by Paul, [contradicting and] speaking injuriously. @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing Yuđa ƀuh ƀing mơnuih lu anŭn, gơñu bă hăng tơlơi moañ nač, pơgăl glaĭ hăng tơlơi Pôl pơhiăp, laih anŭn hơtoh djraĭ gơ̆. 
And Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, It was necessary that the word of God should be first spoken to you; but, since ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the nations; @ Samơ̆ Pôl hăng Barnabas pơhiăp kơ gơñu hăng tơlơi khĭn hăng laĭ: “Tui hăng tơlơi djơ̆, blŭng hlâo gơmơi khŏm pơtô tơlơi Ơi Adai pơhiăp kơ ƀing gih.

And [those of] the nations, hearing it, rejoiced, and glorified the word of the Lord, and believed, as many as were ordained to eternal life. @ Tơ ƀing djuai tuai hmư̆ tơlơi pơhiăp anŭn, gơñu hơ̆k kơdơ̆k pơpŭ bơni hơơč boh pơhiăp Khua Yang.

And the word of the Lord was carried through the whole country. @ Tơlơi Khua Yang pơhiăp lar hyu tar ƀar čar anŭn. 
But the Jews excited the women of the upper classes who were worshippers, and the first people of the city, and raised a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their coasts. @ Samơ̆ ƀing Yuđa pơsur pơtrŭt ƀing đah kơmơi arăng pơpŭ thâo kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai hăng ƀing khua wai lăng plei anŭn pơsur ƀing anai ngă sat kơ Pôl hăng Barnabas laih anŭn puh pơđuaĭ dua gơ̆ mơ̆ng čar gơñu.

And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed. @ Pơ plei Ikôni Pôl hăng Barnabas mŭt amăng sang bơjơnum ƀing ană Yuđa, gơñu pơtô ngă brơi lu mơnuih Yuđa wơ̆t hăng ƀing Grek đaŏ.

They stayed therefore a good while, speaking boldly, [confiding] in the Lord, who gave witness to the word of his grace, giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands. @ Wơ̆t tui anŭn, Pôl hăng Barnabas dŏ sui pơ anŭn pơtô boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai hăng tơlơi khĭn, laih anŭn Khua Yang yua tơngan gơñu ngă tơlơi gru kơnăl mơyang hăng tơlơi mơsêh mơyang kiăng ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ tơlơi pap Khua Yang.

And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to see about this matter. @ Ƀing khua ding kơna hăng ƀing kŏng tha pơƀŭt glaĭ kiăng kơsem lăng tơlơi anŭn. 
And much discussion having taken place, Peter, standing up, said to them, Brethren, *ye* know that from the earliest days God amongst you chose that the nations by my mouth should hear the word of the glad tidings and believe. @ Giơ̆ng hmâo tơlơi črŏng sai klă ten, Pêtrôs tơgŭ laih anŭn laĭ hăng gơñu: “Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, ƀing gih thâo laih mơ̆ng khul hrơi blŭng hlâo Ơi Adai hmâo ruah kâo mơ̆ng tơ̆ng krah ƀing gih, kiăng kơ mơ̆ng amăng bah kâo pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ ƀing djuai tuai, gơñu dưi hmư̆ laih anŭn đaŏ. 
And the heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving [them] the Holy Spirit as to us also, @ Ơi Adai, Pô thâo pran jua rĭm čô mơnuih, hmâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơsĭt kơ tơlơi Ñu tŭ mă ƀing djuai tuai hăng tơlơi Ñu brơi Yang Bơngăt Hiam kơ ƀing gơñu, kar hăng Ñu hmâo brơi laih kơ ƀing ta.

And all the multitude kept silence and listened to Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders which God had wrought among the nations by them. @ Abih bang ƀing bơjơnum leng kơ dŏ rơiăt, gơñu dŏ hmư̆ Barnabas hăng Pôl ră ruai glaĭ abih bang tơlơi gru kơnăl mơyang hăng tơlơi mơsêh mơyang Ơi Adai yua gơñu hmâo ngă laih tơ̆ng krah ƀing djuai tuai. 
And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, listen to me: @ Tơ gơñu pơhiăp giơ̆ng laih, Yakơ pơhiăp: “Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng dŏ hmư̆ kâo bĕ!

And with this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written: @ Tơlơi anŭn hmâo krĕp djơ̆ laih tui hăng tơlơi ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo čih laih,
After these things I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David which is fallen, and will rebuild its ruins, and will set it up, @  ‘Khua Yang laĭ, giơ̆ng tơlơi anai Kâo či wơ̆t glaĭ dơ̆ng,

Then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders, with the whole assembly, to send chosen men from among them with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, Judas called Barsabas and Silas, leading men among the brethren, @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ƀing khua ding kơna, ƀing kŏng tha, hrŏm hơbĭt hăng abih bang Phung Sang Ơi Adai khư̆p ư ruah mơ̆ng amăng ƀing gơñu, hăng pơkiaŏ nao ƀing gơ̆ pơ plei Antiôs hrŏm hăng Pôl laih anŭn Barnabas.

They therefore, being let go, came to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude delivered to [them] the epistle. @ Hnŭn yơh, tơ arăng pơkiaŏ ƀing gơñu nao, gơñu trŭn nao pơ plei Antiôs, iâu pơƀŭt abih bang mơnuih gơñu brơi hră anŭn kơ ƀing gơ̆.

And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brethren with much discourse, and strengthened them. @ Yut hăng Silas ăt jing pô laĭ lui hlâo mơ̆n, yua lu tơlơi pơtô kiăng pơtrŭt pơđĭ pran jua laih anŭn pơkơtang ƀing gơ̆. 
And having passed some time [there], they were let go in peace from the brethren to those who sent them. @ Giơ̆ng kơ gơñu dŏ glaĭ sui ƀiă, ƀing adơi ayŏng đaŏ drông ba gơñu wơ̆t glaĭ hăng tơlơi rơnŭk rơnua pơ ƀing hmâo pơkiaŏ gơñu rai.
And Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and announcing the glad tidings, with many others also, of the word of the Lord. @ Pôl hăng Barnabas dŏ glaĭ pơ plei Antiôs, laih anŭn hrŏm hơbĭt hăng lu mơnuih pơkŏn pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam hăng pơhrăm boh pơhiăp Khua Yang.
But after certain days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return now and visit the brethren in every city where we have announced the word of the Lord, [and see] how they are getting on. @ Sui ƀiă kơ anŭn, Pôl laĭ hăng Barnabas: “Brơi ƀing ta wơ̆t glaĭ čuă ƀing adơi ayŏng amăng rĭm boh plei ƀing ta hmâo pơtô laih boh pơhiăp Khua Yang, kiăng thâo hyư̆m gơñu jing.” 
And Barnabas proposed to take with [them] John also, called Mark; @ Barnabas kiăng jak ba Yôhan pơanăn dơ̆ng Markôs nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu. 
but Paul thought it not well to take with them him who had abandoned them, [going back] from Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work. @ Samơ̆ Pôl pơmĭn ƀu hiam ôh jak ba hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu pô lui hĭ laih gơñu amăng čar Pamphili hăng ƀu nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu amăng bruă ôh. 
There arose therefore very warm feeling, so that they separated from one another; and Barnabas taking Mark sailed away to Cyprus; @ Yua kơ anŭn, hmâo tơlơi pơrơjah kơtang biă mă, tơl dua gơñu pơčơlah hĭ. Barnabas jak ba Markôs nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu đĭ kompăn nao pơ plao ia Čiprơ.

And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies. @ Ñu hyu djŏp djang čar Siri hăng čar Silisi, ngă brơi abih Phung Sang Ơi Adai hmâo tơlơi kơjăp kơtang.
And he came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus, son of a Jewish believing woman, but [the] father a Greek, @ Pôl nao pơ plei Derbơ hăng plei Listrơ. Pơ anŭn hmâo sa čô ding kơna anăn ñu Timôthê, ană đah rơkơi kơ sa čô đah kơmơi Yuđa hmâo đaŏ laih, ama ñu jing sa čô mơnuih Grek.

Him would Paul have go forth with him, and took [him and] circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew his father that he was a Greek. @ Pôl kiăng jak ba Timôthê nao hrŏm hơbĭt; hnŭn yơh ñu ngă tơlơi khăt klĭ gơ̆ yua kơ ƀing Yuđa dŏ amăng tring anŭn, abih bang leng kơ thâo kơ ama ñu jing sa čô mơnuih Grek. 
And as they passed through the cities they instructed them to observe the decrees determined on by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. @ Tơ gơñu găn amăng lu boh plei, gơñu ăt pơtă kơ ƀing adơi ayŏng đaŏ khŏm gưt tơlơi phiăn ƀing khua ding kơna hăng ƀing kŏng tha amăng plei Yêrusalem hmâo pơkă laih.

having come down to Mysia, they attempted to go to Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them; @ Tơ gơñu jĕ truh čar Misia, gơñu kiăng mŭt amăng čar Bithini; samơ̆ Yang Bơngăt Hiam Yêsu ƀu brơi ôh. 
and having passed by Mysia they descended to Troas. @ Tui anŭn yơh gơñu rơbat găn čar Misia laih anŭn trŭn nao pơ plei Trôas. 
And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a certain Macedonian man, standing and beseeching him, and saying, Pass over into Macedonia and help us. @ Amăng mlam Pôl hmâo ƀuh sa rup bơrơđah: Sa čô mơnuih Masêđôn dŏ dơ̆ng kơwưh kơ ñu hăng laĭ: “Rơkâo kơ ih rai pơ Masêđôn hăng djru gơmơi đa!” 
And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to announce to them the glad tidings. @ Tơ Pôl ƀuh rup bơrơđah anŭn, tañ mơtam gơmơi hơduah jơlan nao pơ čar Masêđôn, yua kơ gơmơi thâo klă laih Ơi Adai hmâo iâu gơmơi nao pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam pơ anŭn.
Having sailed therefore away from Troas, we went in a straight course to Samothracia, and on the morrow to Neapolis, @ Tui anŭn gơmơi đĭ kompăn mơ̆ng plei Trôas anăp tơpă nao pơ plao ia Samôtras, laih anŭn hrơi tơdơi kơ anŭn nao truh pơ plei Nêapôlis.

And on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the river, where it was the custom for prayer to be, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had assembled. @ Amăng hrơi saƀat gơmơi tơbiă nao pơ gah rơngiao amăng jang plei, nao jĕ pơ hang ia krong jing anih gơmơi pơmĭn hmâo ƀing Yuđa pơtŭm glaĭ pioh mông iâu laĭ.

And a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard; whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul. @ Hmâo sa čô đah kơmơi amăng ƀing dŏ hmư̆ gơmơi, anăn gơ̆ HʼLiđi mơ̆ng plei Thiatir, sĭ mơdrô khăn mriah huč, jing sa čô mơnuih hwĭ pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai.

And when she had been baptised and her house, she besought [us], saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide [there]. And she constrained us. @ Giơ̆ng kơ ñu tŭ ƀatem hrŏm hơbĭt hăng sang anŏ ñu, HʼLiđi jak ƀing gơmơi hăng laĭ: “Tơdah ƀing ih yap kâo tŏng ten sĭt hăng Khua Yang, mŭt dŏ glaĭ bĕ amăng sang kâo.” Laih anŭn ñu pơđur tơl gơmơi mŭt hĭ.
And it came to pass as we were going to prayer that a certain female slave, having a spirit of Python, met us, who brought much profit to her masters by prophesying. @ Hmâo sa hrơi, tơdang gơmơi nao pơ anih iâu laĭ, gơmơi bưp sa čô đah kơmơi hlŭn hmâo yang sat ngă, ñu thâo laĭ lui hlâo tơlơi či truh pơ anăp.

And this she did many days. And Paul, being distressed, turned, and said to the spirit, I enjoin thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour. @ Ñu ngă tui anŭn amăng lu hrơi, tơl Pôl bơngơ̆t bơngañ ƀu sŭk, tui anŭn ñu wir glaĭ laĭ kơ yang sat: “Amăng anăn Yêsu Krist kâo pơđar kơ ŏng tơbiă bĕ mơ̆ng đah kơmơi anai.” Ƀơi mông anŭn mơtam yang sat tơbiă mơ̆ng ñu.
And her masters, seeing that the hope of their gains was gone, having seized Paul and Silas, dragged [them] into the market before the magistrates; @ Tơ ƀing khua đah kơmơi anŭn ƀuh gơñu rơngiă hĭ laih tơlơi čang rơmang dưi ƀơ̆ng lu prăk, gơñu mă čaŏ Pôl hăng Silas, dui ba gơñu pơ anih sang bruă kơnuk kơna, pioh gơñu ƀơi anăp ƀing khua wai lăng.

And having laid many stripes upon them they cast [them] into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely; @ Giơ̆ng arăng taih ƀing gơ̆ lu laih, gơñu krư̆ hĭ ƀing gơ̆ amăng sang mơnă, hăng pơtă kơ khua sang mơnă gak wai hăng tơlơi kơjăp.

And the jailor being awakened out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword was going to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had fled. @ Khua wai sang mơnă pơdưh hăng ƀuh bah amăng sang mơnă leng kơ pŏk hĭ soh sel, ñu pơmĭn ƀing mơnă đuaĭ abih laih, ñu suă đao kiăng pơdjai ñu pô.

And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and, trembling, fell down before Paul and Silas. @ Pô wai sang mơnă iâu arăng mă apui kơđen hăng nao mŭt amăng sang mơnă. Ñu tơtư̆ drơi jan hăng tơlơi hwĭ biă mă laih anŭn bon ƀơi yŭ tơkai Pôl hăng Silas.

And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, with all that were in his house. @ Gơñu pơtô boh pơhiăp Khua Yang kơ ñu wơ̆t kơ abih bang ƀing dŏ amăng sang ñu. 
And he took them the same hour of the night and washed [them] from their stripes; and was baptised, he and all his straightway. @ Amăng mlam anŭn, ƀơi mông anŭn mơtam, khua sang mơnă ba gơñu tơbiă hăng rao nam rơka gơñu. Laih anŭn ñu hăng abih sang anŏ ñu leng kơ tŭ ƀatem mơtam.

But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly uncondemned, us who are Romans, they have cast us into prison, and now they thrust us out secretly? no, indeed, but let them come themselves and bring us out. @ Samơ̆ Pôl laĭ kơ gơñu: “Gơmơi jing ƀing ană plei pla Rôm; gơñu aka phat kơđi ƀing gơmơi ôh samơ̆ gơñu taih laih gơmơi hăng gai ƀơi anăp ƀing ană plei pla hăng krư̆ hĭ ƀing gơmơi amăng sang mơnă.

And the lictors reported these words to the praetors. And they were afraid when they heard they were Romans. @ Ƀing khua tơhan laĭ pơthâo boh pơhiăp anŭn kơ ƀing khua wai lăng, ƀing gơñu hwĭ biă mă, tơ gơñu thâo Pôl hăng Silas jing ană plei pla Rôm.

And according to Paul's custom he went in among them, and on three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures, @ Tui hăng tơlơi ñu juăt ngă, Pôl mŭt amăng sang bơjơnum, amăng klâo hrơi saƀat ñu pơrơjah pơgăl hăng gơñu, mă mơ̆ng Tơlơi Ơi Adai Pơhiăp,

And some of them believed, and joined themselves to Paul and Silas, and of the Greeks who worshipped, a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few. @ Hmâo đơđa amăng ƀing gơñu tŭ ư nao hrŏm hăng Pôl laih anŭn Silas.

But the Jews having been stirred up to jealousy, and taken to [themselves] certain wicked men of the lowest rabble, and having got a crowd together, set the city in confusion; and having beset the house of Jason sought to bring them out to the people; @ Samơ̆ ƀing Yuđa moañ nač, jak ƀing sat ƀai tă tăn dŏ amăng jơlan glung.

and not having found them, dragged Jason and certain brethren before the politarchs, crying out, These [men] that have set the world in tumult, are come here also, @ Samơ̆ tơ gơñu sem ƀu ƀuh ƀing anŭn ôh, gơñu mă dui ba Jason hăng đơđa ƀing adơi ayŏng đaŏ nao pơ anăp ƀing khua wai lăng plei prŏng, laih anŭn ur: “Ƀing anai hmâo ngă pơrŭng abih lŏn tơnah, ră anai gơñu truh laih pơ anai,

But the brethren immediately sent away, in the night, Paul and Silas to Berea; who, being arrived, went away into the synagogue of the Jews. @ Amăng mlam anŭn mơtam ƀing adơi ayŏng pơkiaŏ Pôl hăng Silas nao pơ plei Bêrê. Tơ gơñu truh laih, gơñu mŭt amăng sang bơjơnum ƀing Yuđa. 
And these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching the scriptures if these things were so. @ Ƀing ană Yuđa pơ anai jing mơnuih hmâo pran jua hiam hloh kơ ƀing pơ plei Têsalônik, yua kơ ƀing gơñu tŭ mă boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai hăng abih pran jua kiăng biă mă, rĭm hrơi gơñu kơsem lăng hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp kiăng thâo kơ tơlơi Pôl pơtô anŭn jing djơ̆ mơ̆.

But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of God was announced in Berea also by Paul, they came there also, stirring up the crowds. @ Samơ̆ tơ ƀing Yuđa pơ plei Têsalônik thâo Pôl ăt pơtô boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai pơ plei Bêrê mơ̆n, gơñu nao pơ anŭn mơ̆n kiăng pơsur ƀing ană plei ngă pơrŭng. 
And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as to the sea; but Silas and Timotheus abode there. @ Hlăk anŭn tañ mơtam ƀing adơi ayŏng pơkiaŏ Pôl nao gah ia rơsĭ. Samơ̆ Silas hăng Timôthê ăt dŏ glaĭ pơ plei Bêrê. 
But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens; and, having received a commandment to Silas and Timotheus, that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they departed. @ Ƀing mơnuih ba Pôl nao truh pơ plei Athen, laih anŭn gơñu wơ̆t glaĭ pơ plei Bêrê, giơ̆ng Pôl hmâo pơtă kơ gơñu brơi laĭ kơ Silas hăng Timôthê khŏm nao pơ ñu jai tañ jai hiam hloh.
But in Athens, while Paul was waiting for them, his spirit was painfully excited in him seeing the city given up to idolatry. @ Tơdang Pôl dŏ tơguan Silas hăng Timôthê pơ plei Athen, Pôl bă hăng tơlơi hil, yua kơ ñu ƀuh plei anŭn bă hăng rup trah. 
He reasoned therefore in the synagogue with the Jews, and those who worshipped, and in the market-place every day with those he met with. @ Tui anŭn, amăng sang bơjơnum Pôl pơrơjah pơgăl hăng ƀing Yuđa wơ̆t hăng ƀing djuai tuai tui tơlơi đaŏ Yuđa, laih anŭn wơ̆t hăng ƀing mơnuih ñu bưp pơ sang sĭ mia rĭm hrơi. 
But some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers attacked him. And some said, What would this chatterer say? and some, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons, because he announced the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection [to them]. @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n hmâo đơđa ƀing hrăm lu amăng tơpul Êpikur laih anŭn ƀing Stôik bưp ñu.

And having taken hold on him they brought [him] to Areopagus, saying, Might we know what this new doctrine which is spoken by thee [is]? @ Gơñu mă Pôl hăng ba nao pơ anih bơjơnum Arêôpa, hăng laĭ: “Dưi mơ̆ ih brơi gơmơi thâo hơgĕt tơlơi pơtô phrâo ih hmâo anŭn?

Now all [the] Athenians and the strangers sojourning there spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the news. @ Yua kơ abih ƀing mơnuih plei Athen hăng abih ƀing djuai tuai dŏ pơ anŭn kơnơ̆ng hơduah kiăng pơhiăp hăng hmư̆ tơlơi phrâo hling đôč.
And Paul standing in the midst of Areopagus said, Athenians, in every way I see you given up to demon worship; @ Tui anŭn Pôl dŏ dơ̆ng tơ̆ng krah ƀơi anih arăng pia Arêôpa hăng laĭ: “Ơ ƀing mơnuih plei Athen, kâo ƀuh ƀing gih hur har biă mă amăng tơlơi kơkuh pơpŭ kơ yang. 
for, passing through and beholding your shrines, I found also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God.

Being therefore [the] offspring of God, we ought not to think that which is divine to be like gold or silver or stone, [the] graven form of man's art and imagination. @ Tui anŭn, yua kơ ƀing ta jing ƀing ană Ơi Adai, anăm ƀing ta pơmĭn ôh kơ Ơi Adai jing kar hăng hơbŏ rup trah ngă hăng mah, prăk, ƀôdah boh pơtâo mơ̆ng bruă tơngan hăng tơlơi rơgơi ană mơnuih ngă.

because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the habitable earth in righteousness by [the] man whom he has appointed, giving the proof [of it] to all [in] having raised him from among [the] dead. @ Yua kơ Ơi Adai hmâo pơkă laih sa hrơi Ñu či brơi sa čô pô Ñu hmâo ruah laih phat kơđi lŏn tơnah hăng tơlơi tơpă.

And when they heard [of the] resurrection of the dead, some mocked, and some said, We will hear thee again also concerning this. @ Tơ gơñu hmư̆ Pôl pơhiăp djơ̆ kơ tơlơi hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng ƀing djai, đơđa mơnuih djik mưč; samơ̆ ƀing pơkŏn laĭ: “Ƀing gơmơi kiăng hmư̆ ih pơhiăp kơ tơlơi anai sa wơ̆t dơ̆ng.” 
Thus Paul went out of their midst. @ Tui anŭn, Pôl tơbiă hĭ mơ̆ng gơñu. 
But some men joining themselves to him believed; among whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name Damaris, and others with them. @ Hmâo đơđa đuaĭ tui hăng ñu laih anŭn đaŏ, amăng ƀing anŭn hmâo Denis jing sa čô amăng tơpul ƀing khua phat kơđi Arêôpa, hăng sa čô đah kơmơi anăn gơ̆ jing HʼDamaris, laih anŭn wơ̆t hăng ƀing mơnuih pơkŏn dơ̆ng.
And after these things, having left Athens, he came to Corinth; @ Giơ̆ng kơ anŭn, Pôl mơ̆ng plei Athen nao pơ plei Kôrantô. 
and finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome,) came to them, @ Pơ anŭn ñu bưp sa čô mơnuih Yuđa anăn ñu Akilas mơnuih čar Pônt, mơ̆ng čar Itali hrŏm hơbĭt hăng bơnai ñu HʼPrisil phrâo truh, yua kơ pơtao Klôd hmâo pơđar laih brơi abih bang ƀing Yuđa tơbiă mơ̆ng plei Rôm.

And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. @ Tơ Silas hăng Timôthê mơ̆ng čar Masêđôn truh, Pôl pioh hăng abih pran jua kơnơ̆ng kơ tơlơi pơtô, pơhrăm hăng ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơklă brơi kơ ƀing Yuđa kơ Yêsu jing Yang Krist. 
But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head: *I* [am] pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations. @ Ƀing Yuđa pơkơdơ̆ng hăng hơtoh djraĭ kơ ñu, Pôl rơyuh ao ñu hăng laĭ kơ ƀing anŭn: “Brơi drah ƀing gih tuh glaĭ ƀơi akŏ ƀing gih pô.

And departing thence he came to the house of a certain [man], by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue. @ Ñu tơbiă mơ̆ng anŭn hăng mŭt amăng sang sa čô đah rơkơi anăn ñu Titus Justus, sa čô mơnuih kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai; sang ñu ƀơi guai hăng sang bơjơnum.

But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one consent rose against Paul and led him to the judgment-seat, @ Hlăk Galiôn ngă khua wai kwar Akai, ƀing Yuđa pơgop glaĭ pơkơdơ̆ng hăng Pôl laih anŭn mă ba ñu pơ sang phat kơđi,

But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, of reason I should have borne with you; @ Tơ Pôl čơdơ̆ng ha pơhiăp, Galiôn laĭ kơ ƀing Yuđa: “Ơ ƀing Yuđa, tơdah hmâo tơlơi hơgĕt soh ƀôdah sat ƀai, sĭt kâo hmâo tơlơi klih yua gir kiăng kơ dŏ hmư̆ ƀing gih.

And he drove them from the judgment-seat. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Galiôn puh pơđuaĭ hĭ gơñu mơ̆ng sang phat kơđi. 
And having all laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, they beat him before the judgment-seat.

And Paul, having yet stayed [there] many days, took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow; @  Giơ̆ng tơlơi anŭn Pôl dŏ glaĭ sui hrơi dơ̆ng pơ plei Kôrantô.

And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater [son] of Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus. @ Sôpatê ană đah rơkơi Pirus plei Bêrê nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu.

but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and we came to them to Troas in five days, where we spent seven days. @ Giơ̆ng hrơi phĕt Ƀañ Tơpŭng Ƀu Hmâo Tơpơi, gơmơi đĭ kompăn mơ̆ng plei Philip, laih anŭn rơgao rơma hrơi gơmơi bưp ƀing gơñu pơ plei Trôas.

And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break bread, Paul discoursed to them, about to depart on the morrow. And he prolonged the discourse till midnight. @ Hrơi tal sa amăng hrơi kơ̆m, tơdang ƀing gơmơi bơjơnum glaĭ kiăng wơ̆k ƀañ tơpŭng.

And there were many lights in the upper room where we were assembled. @ Amăng adŭ tal glong anih gơmơi bơjơnum hmâo lu apui kơđen. 
And a certain youth, by name Eutychus, sitting at the window-opening, overpowered by deep sleep, while Paul discoursed very much at length, having been overpowered by the sleep, fell from the third story down to the bottom, and was taken up dead. @ Hmâo sa čô tơdăm anăn ñu Ơtik dŏ ber ƀơi bah amăng phă.

But Paul descending fell upon him, and enfolding [him] [in his arms], said, Be not troubled, for his life is in him. @ Samơ̆ Pôl trŭn, ñu tơkui krôp mă ñu hăng laĭ: “Anăm rŭng răng ôh, ñu ăt dŏ hơdip đôč!” 
And having gone up, and having broken the bread, and eaten, and having long spoken until daybreak, so he went away. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn Pôl đĭ glaĭ pơ adŭ tal glong dơ̆ng, ñu wơ̆k ƀañ tơpŭng hăng ƀơ̆ng. Ñu pơhiăp ră ruai hăng gơñu dơ̆ng sui tơl truh mơguah, laih anŭn ñu nao yơh.

And we, having gone before on board ship, sailed off to Assos, going to take in Paul there; for so he had directed, he himself being about to go on foot. @ Gơmơi đĭ kompăn nao hlâo pơ plei Asôs. Pơ anŭn gơmơi či bưp Pôl; yua kơ Pôl kiăng nao jơlan lŏn, hnŭn yơh ñu hmâo pơkra laih tui anŭn.

and having sailed thence, on the morrow arrived opposite Chios, and the next day put in at Samos; and having stayed at Trogyllium, the next day we came to Miletus: @ Mơ̆ng anŭn gơmơi đĭ kompăn laih anŭn hrơi pơgi gơmơi truh pơ gah anăp plao ia Čiôs.

for Paul thought it desirable to sail by Ephesus, so that he might not be made to spend time in Asia; for he hastened, if it was possible for him, to be the day of Pentecost at Jerusalem. @ Yua kơ Pôl khư̆p ư kơnơ̆ng găn lui plei Êphêsô, ƀu jưh pơ anŭn ôh hwĭ kơ rơngiă hĭ hrơi mông amăng kwar Asi.

But I make no account of [my] life [as] dear to myself, so that I finish my course, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the glad tidings of the grace of God. @ Samơ̆ kâo ƀu yap tơlơi hơdip kâo jing yom kơ kâo pô ôh, tŭ kơ ngă pơgiơ̆ng hĭ abih bruă kâo hmâo mă tŭ laih mơ̆ng Khua Yang Yêsu, kiăng kâo pơhaih Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ tơlơi pap Ơi Adai.

And now I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build [you] up and give [to you] an inheritance among all the sanctified. @ Ră anai kâo jao ƀing gih kơ Ơi Adai laih anŭn kơ boh pơhiăp tơlơi pap Ñu, jing boh pơhiăp dưi pơdơ̆ng hăng pha brơi kong ngăn kơ ƀing gih hrŏm hơbĭt hăng abih bang ƀing mơnuih rơgoh hiam.

And having said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. @ Giơ̆ng Pôl pơhiăp khul tơlơi anŭn, ñu tŏ tơŭt iâu laĭ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng abih bang ƀing gơ̆. 
And they all wept sore; and falling upon the neck of Paul they ardently kissed him, @ Abih bang gơñu leng kơ hia soh sel, hăng kuar mă tơkuai Pôl laih anŭn čŭm. 
specially pained by the word which he had said, that they would no more see his face. And they went down with him to the ship. @ Gơñu ruă rơngot hloh dơ̆ng, yua kơ tơlơi Pôl laĭ ƀing gơñu ƀu či ƀuh ƀô̆ mơta ñu dơ̆ng ôh. Giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu drông ba Pôl truh pơ kompăn.
And when, having got away from them, we at last sailed away, we came by a direct course to Cos, and on the morrow to Rhodes, and thence to Patara. @ Ƀing gơmơi čơlah mơ̆ng gơñu, gơmơi đĭ kompăn hăng nao tơpă pơ plei Kôs. Hrơi tơdơi gơmơi truh pơ plei Rôt, hăng mơ̆ng anŭn gơmơi nao truh pơ plei Patara. 
And having found a ship passing over into Phoenicia, we went on board and sailed; @ Gơmơi ƀuh pơ anŭn sa boh kompăn nao pơ čar Phênisi, tui anŭn gơmơi đĭ kompăn hăng nao yơh. 
and having sighted Cyprus, and left it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and made the land at Tyre, for there the ship was to discharge her cargo. @ Tơ gơmơi ƀuh plao ia Čiprơ, gơmơi găn nao gah dơnŭng kơ plao anai hlŏng truh pơ čar Siri, laih anŭn gơmơi trŭn ƀơi hang plei Tir; yua kơ pơ anŭn arăng khŏm pơtrŭn hĭ gơnam mơ̆ng kompăn. 
And having found out the disciples, we remained there seven days; who said to Paul by the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem. @ Giơ̆ng gơmơi hơduah ƀuh laih ƀing ding kơna, gơmơi dŏ pơ anŭn tơjuh hrơi. Ƀing đaŏ hmâo Yang Bơngăt Hiam pơtrŭt, gơñu laĭ kơ Pôl anăm đĭ nao pơ Yêrusalem ôh. 
But when we had completed the days, we set out and took our journey, all of them accompanying us, with wives and children, till [we were] out of the city. And kneeling down upon the shore we prayed. @ Samơ̆ tơ hrơi gơmơi dŏ jưh pơ anŭn abih laih, gơmơi nao dơ̆ng.

And we, having completed the voyage, arrived from Tyre at Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained one day with them. @ Mơ̆ng plei Tir gơmơi đĭ kompăn nao truh pơ plei Pôtôlêmê. Gơmơi čuă ngui ƀing adơi ayŏng đaŏ hăng dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu sa hrơi. 
And leaving on the morrow, we came to Caesarea; and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was of the seven, we abode with him. @ Hrơi tơdơi gơmơi nao pơ plei Sêsarê, gơmơi mŭt dŏ amăng sang Philip pô pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam.

Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied. @ Ñu hmâo pă čô ană dra aka dŏ rơkơi, gơñu hmâo tơlơi pha brơi thâo pơhiăp laĭ lui hlâo. 
And as we stayed there many days, a certain man, by name Agabus, a prophet, came down from Judaea, @ Tơdang ƀing gơmơi dŏ pơ anŭn ƀiă hrơi, hmâo sa čô pô laĭ lui hlâo anăn ñu Agabus trŭn rai mơ̆ng Yuđa. 
and coming to us and taking the girdle of Paul, and having bound his own hands and feet, said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, The man whose this girdle is shall the Jews thus bind in Jerusalem, and deliver him up into the hands of [the] Gentiles. @ Ñu truh pơ ƀing gơmơi, ñu mă hơdrăng kơiăng Pôl, akă tơkai tơngan pô ñu hăng laĭ: “Anai jing boh pơhiăp Yang Bơngăt Hiam laĭ: ‘Kar hăng anai yơh ƀing Yuđa pơ Yêrusalem či čăp hĭ pô hơdrăng kơiăng anai laih anŭn gơñu či jao hĭ gơ̆ amăng tơngan ƀing djuai tuai.’” 
And when we heard these things, both we and those of the place besought [him] not to go up to Jerusalem. @ Tơ gơmơi hmư̆ hơdôm tơlơi anŭn, gơmơi hăng ƀing đaŏ pơ anŭn kơwưh kơ Pôl anăm đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem ôh. 
But Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my heart? for *I* am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. @ Samơ̆ Pôl laĭ glaĭ: “Ƀing gih ngă hơgĕt, ƀing gih hia tui anŭn ngă pơruă pran jua kâo?

And after these days, having got our effects ready, we went up to Jerusalem. @ Tơdơi kơ khul hrơi anŭn, ƀing gơmơi prăp rơmet gơnam hăng đĭ nao pơ Yêrusalem. 
And [some] of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing [with them] a certain Mnason, a Cyprian, an old disciple, with whom we were to lodge. @ Hmâo đơđa ƀing ding kơna mơ̆ng plei Sêsarê nao hrŏm hăng gơmơi.

And having saluted them, he related one by one the things which God had wrought among the nations by his ministry. @ Giơ̆ng kơkuh tơña hăng ƀing gơñu, Pôl ră ruai abih tơlơi Ơi Adai hmâo ngă laih tơ̆ng krah ƀing Djuai Tuai găn mơ̆ng bruă mơnuă ñu. 
And they having heard [it] glorified God, and said to him, Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law. @ Tơ gơñu hmư̆ giơ̆ng tơlơi anŭn, abih gơñu pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai.

take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses, that they may have their heads shaved; and all will know that [of those things] of which they have been informed about thee nothing is [true]; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, keeping the law. @ Ba bĕ ƀing anŭn hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ih, ngă phĕt pơrơgoh ih pô hrŏm hăng ƀing gơñu tui hăng tơlơi juăt laih anŭn kla prăk brơi kơ ƀing gơñu kuah ƀuk.

But concerning [those of] the nations who have believed, we have written, deciding that they should [observe no such thing, only to] keep themselves both from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication. @ Bơ kơ ƀing djuai tuai hmâo đaŏ laih, gơmơi hmâo mơit laih hră čih tơlơi gơmơi khư̆p ư, brơi kơ̆m ƀơ̆ng mơnơ̆ng ngă yang, kơ̆m ƀơ̆ng drah ƀôdah hlô mơnơ̆ng djai hơngơ̆t, hăng kơ̆m klĕ pyu.” 
Then Paul, taking the men, on the next day, having been purified, entered with them into the temple, signifying the time the days of the purification would be fulfilled, until the offering was offered for every one of them. @ Tui anŭn Pôl jak ba ƀing mơnuih anŭn, laih anŭn hrơi tơdơi hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing anŭn ngă phĕt pơrơgoh, laih anŭn ñu mŭt amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, brơi gơñu thâo hơbin hrơi phĕt pơrơgoh či giơ̆ng tum laih anŭn mơnơ̆ng ngă yang rĭm čô amăng ƀing gơñu khŏm pơyơr.
And when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews from Asia, having seen him in the temple, set all the crowd in a tumult, and laid hands upon him, @ Tơ tơjuh hrơi anŭn giăm abih laih, ƀing Yuđa mơ̆ng kwar Asi ƀuh Pôl amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, gơñu pơsur ƀing ană plei pla ngă tơlơi pơrŭng laih anŭn mă Pôl. 
crying, Israelites, help! this is the man who teaches all everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and has brought Greeks too into the temple, and profaned this holy place. @ Gơñu ur kraih: “Ơ ană plei pla Israel hơi, rai djru ƀing gơmơi đa!

For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple. @ Kơlih yua hlâo kơ anŭn gơñu hmâo ƀuh Trôphim, mơnuih Êphêsô, dŏ hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Pôl amăng plei anŭn, hnŭn yơh gơñu pơmĭn dah Pôl hmâo jak ba pô anŭn mŭt amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ. 
And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people; and having laid hold on Paul they drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut. @ Abih bang ană plei hmâo tơlơi rŭng răng, laih anŭn abih bang ană plei hrŏm hơbĭt đuaĭ nao.

And as they were seeking to kill him, a representation came to the chiliarch of the band that the whole of Jerusalem was in a tumult; @ Tơdang gơñu hơduah jơlan kiăng pơdjai hĭ Pôl, tơlơi arăng laĭ pơthâo truh pơ khua tơhan Rôm thâo kơ abih amăng plei Yêrusalem hmâo tơlơi rŭng răng. 
who, taking with him immediately soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them. But they, seeing the chiliarch and the soldiers, ceased beating Paul. @ Tañ mơtam, ñu ba tơhan wơ̆t ƀing khua tơhan kơ sa rơtuh čô, hăng nao pơ ƀing mơnuih lu.

Then the chiliarch came up and laid hold upon him, and commanded [him] to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he might be, and what he had done. @ Khua tơhan nao giăm, mă Pôl hăng pơtă arăng čăp hĭ gơ̆ hăng dua ară hrĕ jal. Giơ̆ng anŭn ñu tơña hlơi ih jing, laih anŭn hơgĕt ih hmâo ngă laih? 
And different persons cried some different thing in the crowd. But he, not being able to know the certainty on account of the uproar, commanded him to be brought into the fortress. @ Amăng ƀing mơnuih lu, đơđa mơnuih ur tui anai, đơđa ur tui anŭn; laih anŭn yua kơ tơlơi pơrơông pơrơang, khua tơhan ƀu thâo sĭt ôh hyưm tơlơi anŭn jing, hnŭn yơh ñu pơđar arăng ba Pôl nao pơ kơđông.

For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Away with him. @ Ƀing mơnuih lu đuaĭ tui klon ur laĭ: “Pơdjai hĭ ñu!”
But as he was about to be led into the fortress, Paul says to the chiliarch, Is it allowed me to say something to thee? And he said, Dost thou know Greek? @ Tơ arăng giăm ba ñu mŭt amăng kơđông, Pôl laĭ hăng khua tơhan: “Dưi mơ̆ kâo pơhiăp ƀiă hăng ih?” Khua tơhan laĭ: “Ih thâo pơhiăp tơlơi Grek hă?

But Paul said, *I* am a Jew of Tarsus, citizen of no insignificant city of Cilicia, and I beseech of thee, allow me to speak to the people. @ Pôl laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo jing sa čô Yuđa mơ̆ng plei Tars čar Silisi sa čô ană plei amăng sa boh plei prŏng yom. Rơkâo kơ ih brơi kâo pơhiăp hăng ană plei.” 
And when he had allowed him, Paul, standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and a great silence having been made, he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, @ Khua tơhan brơi Pôl pơhiăp, Pôl dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi rơñan, yơr tơngan kơ ƀing ană plei; tơ abih mơnuih dŏ rơiăt laih, ñu pơhiăp hăng tơlơi Hêbrơ, tui anai:

And hearing that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue, they kept the more quiet; and he says, @ Tơ gơñu hmư̆ Pôl pơhiăp hăng tơlơi Hêbrơ, gơñu dŏ rơiăt hloh dơ̆ng. Pôl laĭ:

And it came to pass, as I was journeying and drawing near to Damascus, that, about mid-day, there suddenly shone out of heaven a great light round about me. @ “Tơdang kâo rơbat giăm truh pơ plei Damas, amăng kơplah wah yang hrơi dơ̆ng, blĭp hmâo tơlơi bơngač kơmlă mơ̆ng adai pơčrang jum dar kâo. 
And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? @ Kâo rơbuh lĕ pơ lŏn hăng hmư̆ asăp pơhiăp hăng kâo: ‘Ơ Sôl, Ơ Sôl, hyư̆m ih ngă sat kơ Kâo?’

But they that were with me beheld the light, [and were filled with fear], but heard not the voice of him that was speaking to me. @ Ƀing nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng kâo ƀuh tơlơi bơngač anŭn samơ̆ ƀu hmư̆ ôh asăp pô dŏ pơhiăp hăng kâo.

And as I could not see, through the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to Damascus. @ Yua kơ tơlơi bơngač kơmlă kơtang anŭn ngă kơ mơta kâo ƀu thâo ƀuh tah, ƀing nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng kâo djă tơngan hăng dui ba kâo truh pơ plei Damas.
And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law, borne witness to by all the Jews who dwelt [there], @ Hmâo sa čô anăn ñu Ananias, jing mơnuih tơpă hiam hur har ngă tui hăng tơlơi juăt, hmâo tơlơi ngă gơ̆ng jơlan hiam mơ̆ng abih bang ƀing Yuđa dŏ pơ plei Damas.

And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy, @ “Kâo wơ̆t glaĭ pơ Yêrusalem laih anŭn hlăk kâo dŏ iâu laĭ amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, kâo hmâo tơlơi pơƀuh,

And *I* said, Lord, they themselves know that *I* was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe on thee; @ Kâo laĭ: ‘Ơ Khua Yang, gơñu pô yơh hmâo thâo laih kơ tơlơi kâo mă krư̆ hăng taih amăng ƀing đaŏ kơ Ih amăng rĭm boh sang bơjơnum. 
and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of them who killed him. @ Laih anŭn dơ̆ng tơ Êtiên jing pô ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ Ih hmâo tuh drah, kâo kar kaĭ mơ̆n dŏ jĕ pơ anŭn tŭ ư hrŏm hơbĭt hăng tơlơi gơñu ngă, laih anŭn dŏ wai sum ao ƀing pơdjai ñu.’

And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth, for it was not fit he should live. @ Gơñu dŏ hmư̆ Pôl truh dơ̆ boh pơhiăp anŭn, hlăk anŭn gơñu čơdơ̆ng ur kraih: “Pơrơngiă hĭ bĕ mơnuih kar hăng anŭn mơ̆ng lŏn tơnah!

And as they were crying, and throwing away their clothes, and casting dust into the air, @ Tơdang gơñu ur hrek, glŏm sum ao laih anŭn kuaĭ ƀruih lŏn sai đĭ hăng ngŏ. 
the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the fortress, saying that he should be examined by scourging, that he might ascertain for what cause they cried thus against him. @ Khua tơhan pơđar arăng ba Pôl mŭt amăng kơđông, yua gai hnuăt hrĕ taih kiăng thâo yua kơ hơgĕt ƀing mơnuih lu ur pơkơdơ̆ng hăng ñu tui anŭn. 
But as they stretched him forward with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood [by], Is it lawful for you to scourge a man [who is] a Roman and uncondemned? @ Samơ̆ tơ arăng akă dăng ñu kiăng kơ taih ñu, Pôl laĭ hăng sa čô khua kơ sa rơtuh čô dŏ jĕ ƀơi anŭn: “Phiăn mơ̆ kơ ƀing gih taih sa čô mơnuih Rôm tơdang akă phat kơđi ñu ôh?”
And the centurion, having heard it, went and reported it to the chiliarch, saying, What art thou going to do? for this man is a Roman. @ Tơ khua tơhan hmư̆ tơlơi Pôl pơhiăp tui anŭn, ñu nao tơña khua prŏng wai tơhan hăng laĭ: “Hyư̆m ih či ngă tơlơi anai? Yua kơ pô anai jing mơnuih Rôm.”
And the chiliarch coming up said to him, Tell me, Art *thou* a Roman? And he said, Yes. @ Tui anŭn khua prŏng nao pơ Pôl hăng laĭ: “Laĭ brơi kâo bĕ, ih jing mơnuih Rôm hă?”
Pôl laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ, djơ̆ yơh.”
And the chiliarch answered, *I*, for a great sum, bought this citizenship. And Paul said, But *I* was also [free] born. @ Khua prŏng laĭ: “Kâo blơi tơlơi dưi jing ană plei Rôm hăng nua prăk yom biă mă.”
Pôl laĭ: “Samơ̆ kâo jing sa čô mơnuih Rôm čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng amĭ tơkeng.”
Immediately therefore those who were going to examine him left him, and the chiliarch also was afraid when he ascertained that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. @ Tui anŭn ƀing kiăng kơsem tơña Pôl leng kơ đuaĭ mơ̆ng ñu mơtam; laih anŭn khua prŏng hwĭ biă mă, tơ ñu thâo pô ñu hmâo čăp laih, anŭn jing sa čô mơnuih Rôm.
And on the morrow, desirous to know the certainty [of the matter] why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and having brought Paul down set him before them. @ Tơ truh hrơi pơgi, khua prŏng kiăng thâo sĭt yua kơ tơlơi hơgĕt ƀing Yuđa phong kơ Pôl, hnŭn yơh ñu kleh hĭ gơ̆, laih anŭn pơtă kơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng abih bang ƀing khua phat kơđi bơjơnum glaĭ, laih anŭn ba Pôl dŏ ƀơi anăp ƀing anŭn.
And Paul, fixing his eyes on the council, said, Brethren, I have walked in all good conscience with God unto this day. @ Pôl lăng tơpă nao pơ ƀing bơjơnum, hăng laĭ: “Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, kâo dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai hăng abih pran jua tơpă hiam klă bơngač truh pơ hrơi anai.” 
But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him to smite his mouth. @ Khua ngă yang prŏng hloh Ananias pơđar kơ ƀing dŏ jĕ Pôl pah hĭ amăng bah gơ̆. 
Then Paul said to him, God will smite thee, whited wall. And *thou*, dost thou sit judging me according to the law, and breaking the law commandest me to be smitten? @ Pôl laĭ kơ ñu: “Ơ pơnăng pik čur kŏ anŭn hơi, Ơi Adai či taih hĭ ih. Ih dŏ ber kiăng phat kơđi kâo tui hăng tơlơi juăt samơ̆ ih ngă gao tơlơi juăt, pơđar arăng taih kâo!”
And those that stood by said, Dost thou rail against the high priest of God? @ Ƀing dŏ dơ̆ng jĕ ñu laĭ: “Hyư̆m ih djik djak khua ngă yang prŏng hloh Ơi Adai?”
And Paul said, I was not conscious, brethren, that he was high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evilly of the ruler of thy people. @  Pôl laĭ: “Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, kâo ƀu thâo ôh kơ ñu jing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh; yua kơ hơdrôm Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih tui anai: ‘Anăm pơhiăp sat ôh kơ khua wai lăng ană plei ih.’”
But Paul, knowing that the one part [of them] were of the Sadducees and the other of the Pharisees, cried out in the council, Brethren, *I* am a Pharisee, son of Pharisees: *I* am judged concerning the hope and resurrection of [the] dead. @  Tơ Pôl thâo amăng ƀing gơñu hmâo đơđa jing ƀing Sadusi laih anŭn đơđa ƀing pơkŏn jing ƀing Pharisi, ñu ur kraih ƀơi anăp ƀing phat kơđi: “Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, kâo jing sa čô Pharisi, ană đah rơkơi sa čô Pharisi. Yua kơ tơlơi čang rơmang kơ tơlơi hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng tơlơi djai, hnŭn yơh arăng phat kơđi kâo.”
And when he had spoken this, there was a tumult of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided. @ Giơ̆ng ñu pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, ƀing Pharisi pơrơjah hăng ƀing Sadusi, laih anŭn ƀing bơjơnum pơčơlah pơpha hĭ. 
For Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit; but Pharisees confess both of them. @ Yua kơ ƀing Sadusi laĭ ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơdip glaĭ ôh, kŏn hmâo ling jang ƀôdah bơngăt mơyang lơi. Samơ̆ ƀing Pharisi đaŏ kơ abih tơlơi anŭn. 
And there was a great clamour, and the scribes of the Pharisees' part rising up contended, saying, We find nothing evil in this man; and if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel @ Tui anŭn hmâo asăp ur prŏng. Hmâo đơđa ƀing nai pơtô tơlơi juăt amăng ƀing Pharisi tơgŭ hăng pơgăl kơtang biă mă: “Gơmơi ƀu ƀuh sa mơta tơlơi soh hơgĕt ôh amăng mơnuih anai. Hyư̆m dưi thâo, năng ai bơngăt mơyang ƀôdah ling jang Ơi Adai hmâo pơhiăp laih hăng ñu tơlơi hơgĕt thâo?”
And a great tumult having arisen, the chiliarch, fearing lest Paul should have been torn in pieces by them, commanded the troop to come down and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring [him] into the fortress. @ Tơlơi pơrơjah anŭn jai kơtang hloh dơ̆ng, khua gĭt gai tơhan hwĭ kơ arăng hek hĭ drơi jan Pôl, tui anŭn yơh ñu pơđar ƀing tơhan trŭn sua mă Pôl mơ̆ng ƀing gơñu ba mŭt amăng kơđông.
But the following night the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good courage; for as thou hast testified the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome also. @ Mlam tơdơi kơ anŭn, Khua Yang dŏ dơ̆ng jĕ Pôl hăng laĭ: “Anăm tơdu pran jua ôh, yua kơ kar hăng ih hmâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan laih kơ Kâo pơ plei Yêrusalem, tui anŭn ih či ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ Kâo pơ plei Rôm kar kaĭ mơ̆n.”
And when it was day, the Jews, having banded together, put themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they should kill Paul. @ Tơ truh mơguah ƀing Yuđa pơƀŭt hrŏm hơbĭt, dưm tơlơi mơneč hăng ƀuăn rơ̆ng hăng tơdruă gơñu ƀu ƀơ̆ng huă kŏn mơñum lơi tơl gơñu dưi pơdjai hĭ Pôl. 
And they were more than forty who had joined together in this oath; @ Ƀing hrŏm hơbĭt ngă tơlơi anŭn hmâo rơbeh kơ pă pluh čô. 
and they went to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have cursed ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul. @ Gơñu nao pơ ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing kŏng tha, hăng laĭ: “Gơmơi hmâo ƀuăn rơ̆ng laih hăng tơdruă ƀu či ƀơ̆ng huă ôh tơl gơmơi dưi pơdjai hĭ Pôl. 
Now therefore do ye with the council make a representation to the chiliarch so that he may bring him down to you, as about to determine more precisely what concerns him, and we, before he draws near, are ready to kill him. @ Tui anŭn ră anai, rơkâo kơ ƀing gih hăng ƀing khua phat kơđi rơkâo kơ khua gĭt gai tơhan ba rai Pôl pơ anăp ƀing gih, ngă mă kar hăng ƀing gih kiăng kơsem phat brơi kơđi ñu klă ten hloh.

But Paul's sister's son, having heard of the lying in wait, came and entered into the fortress and reported [it] to Paul. @ Samơ̆ ană đah rơkơi amai Pôl thâo hĭ tơlơi dưm mơneč anŭn, tui anŭn ñu nao mŭt amăng kơđông, hăng laĭ brơi Pôl thâo. 
And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Take this youth to the chiliarch, for he has something to report to him. @ Pôl iâu sa čô khua tơhan hăng laĭ: “Ba nao bĕ tơdăm anai pơ khua gĭt gai tơhan, yua kơ gơ̆ hmâo tơlơi kiăng pơthâo kơ ñu.” 
He therefore, having taken him with [him], led him to the chiliarch, and says, The prisoner Paul called me to [him] and asked me to lead this youth to thee, who has something to say to thee. @ Tui anŭn khua tơhan ba tơdăm anŭn pơ khua gĭt gai tơhan hăng laĭ: “Pôl, pô jing mơnă iâu kâo hăng rơkâo kơ kâo ba tơdăm anai pơ ih, yua kơ ñu hmâo tơlơi kiăng pơhiăp hăng ih.”
And the chiliarch having taken him by the hand, and having gone apart in private, inquired, What is it that thou hast to report to me? @ Khua gĭt gai tơhan djă tơngan ñu, ba gơ̆ pơ anih hơjăn hăng tơña kơ ñu: “Hơgĕt tơlơi ih kiăng laĭ pơthâo hăng kâo?”
And he said, The Jews have agreed together to make a request to thee, that thou mayest bring Paul down to-morrow into the council, as about to inquire something more precise concerning him. @ Ñu laĭ: “Ƀing Yuđa sa pran jua kiăng rơkâo kơ ih ba Pôl nao pơ anăp ƀing khua phat kơđi hrơi pơgi, gơñu ngă kar hăng gơñu kiăng kơsem kơ tơlơi Pôl ten klă hloh. 
Do not thou then be persuaded by them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have put themselves under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they kill him; and now they are ready waiting the promise from thee. @ Samơ̆ anăm ih hmư̆ ƀing anŭn ôh, yua kơ hmâo rơbeh kơ pă pluh čô amăng ƀing gơñu dŏ krăp kiăng ngă kơ Pôl.

The chiliarch then dismissed the youth, commanding [him], Utter to no one that thou hast represented these things to me. @ Tui anŭn, khua tơhan brơi tơdăm anŭn glaĭ hăng khă anăm laĭ kơ hlơi hlơi ôh abih tơlơi gơ̆ hmâo laĭ kơ ñu.
And having called to [him] certain two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go as far as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred light-armed footmen, for the third hour of the night. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn khua gĭt gai tơhan iâu dua čô khua tơhan khul sa rơtuh hăng laĭ: “Ƀơi dua rơpăn mông mlam anai, prăp rơmet hăng pre lui bĕ dua rơtuh čô tơhan rơbat, tơjuh pluh čô tơhan đĭ aseh hăng dua rơtuh čô tơhan djă tơbăk kiăng kơ nao pơ Sêsarê.

And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that excellent measures are executed for this nation by thy forethought, @ Tơ arăng iâu Pôl mŭt laih, Tertulus čơdơ̆ng phong kơ gơ̆ tui anai: “Ơ khua čar, ơi Phêlik, yua kơ mơ̆ng ih gơmơi hmâo lu tơlơi rơnŭk rơnua, laih anŭn yua mơ̆ng tơlơi thâo mĭn ih, čar anai hmâo lu tơlơi pơplih hiam.

And the Jews also joined in pressing the matter against [Paul], saying that these things were so. @ Ƀing mơnuih Yuđa ăt sa pran jua hrŏm hơbĭt hăng tơlơi phong anŭn, laih anŭn khŭt khăt tơlơi anŭn jing sĭt.
But Paul, the governor having beckoned to him to speak, answered, Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge to this nation, I answer readily as to the things which concern myself. @ Tơ khua čar yơr tơngan ngă gru brơi Pôl pơhiăp, Pôl laĭ glaĭ:

and neither in the temple did they find me discoursing to any one, or making any tumultuous gathering together of the crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city; @ Gơñu aka ƀu ƀuh ôh kâo pơrơjah hăng arăng ƀôdah pơsur ƀing ană plei pla ngă pơrŭng, thâo dah amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, thâo dah amăng sang bơjơnum, ƀôdah amăng plei prŏng.

But this I avow to thee, that in the way which they call sect, so I serve my fathers' God, believing all things which are written throughout the law, and in the prophets; @ Samơ̆ kâo tŭ ư tơlơi anai ƀơi anăp ih, kâo kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai ƀing ơi gơmơi tui Jơlan gơñu laĭ jing soh, samơ̆ kâo đaŏ abih tơlơi hmâo čih laih amăng hơdrôm hră tơlơi Juăt Môis hăng hơdrôm hră ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo.

For this cause I also exercise [myself] to have in everything a conscience without offence towards God and men. @ Ăt yua kơ tơlơi anŭn, nanao kâo gir tui hơduah kiăng hmâo pran jua tơpă rơgoh hiam, ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi ƀuah ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai laih anŭn ƀơi anăp ană mơnuih.

Whereupon they found me purified in the temple, with neither crowd nor tumult. But it was certain Jews from Asia, @ Gơñu ƀuh kâo hlăk dŏ ngă phĕt pơrơgoh amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, ƀu hmâo pơƀŭt mơnuih lu ƀôdah ngă tơlơi pơrŭng hơgĕt ôh.

And Felix, knowing accurately the things concerning the way, adjourned them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch is come down I will determine your affair; @ Samơ̆ Phêlik, hmâo thâo rơđah mơ̆n kơ Jơlan anai, pơhrưĭ glaĭ hrơi phat kơđi hăng laĭ: “Tơ Lisias khua gĭt gai tơhan rai amơĭ, kâo či khư̆p ư bruă anai.” 
ordering the centurion to keep him, and that he should have freedom, and to hinder none of his friends to minister to him. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ñu pơđar kơ khua tơhan kơ̆ng wai Pôl, samơ̆ khŏm brơi kơ gơ̆ tơlơi rơngai ƀiă, laih anŭn anăm khă ôh ƀing giăng mah ñu rai ba mơnơ̆ng djru.
And after certain days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. @ Giơ̆ng kơ ƀiă hrơi mơ̆ng anŭn, Phêlik hrŏm hơbĭt hăng bơnai ñu HʼDrusil, mơnuih Yuđa rai; laih anŭn ñu pơkiaŏ nao arăng iâu Pôl kiăng kơ hmư̆ ñu pơtô tơlơi đaŏ amăng Yêsu Krist. 
And as he reasoned concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix, being filled with fear, answered, Go for the present, and when I get an opportunity I will send for thee; @ Samơ̆ tơ Pôl pơtô hiăp djơ̆ kơ tơlơi tơpă, tơlơi djơ̆ hơnơ̆ng laih anŭn kơ tơlơi phat kơđi hrơi tơdơi, Phêlik hwĭ hăng laĭ: “Ră anai ih tơbiă bĕ; Dơ̆ kâo wăn kâo či iâu ih dơ̆ng.” 
hoping at the same time that money would be given him by Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed with him. @ Tơdang anŭn Phêlik čang rơmang kơ Pôl brơi prăk apah hơgơ̆m kơ ñu, hnŭn yơh ñu iâu nanao Pôl nao pơ ñu hăng pơhiăp hăng gơ̆.
But when two years were completed, Felix was relieved by Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desirous to oblige the Jews, to acquire their favour, left Paul bound. @ Rơgao dua thŭn mơ̆ng anŭn, Pôrtus Phêtus nao plih Phêlik. Yua kơ Phêlik kiăng ngă bơmơak kơ ƀing Yuđa, hnŭn yơh ñu ăt dŏ brơi arăng krư̆ Pôl.
Festus therefore, being come into the eparchy, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. @ Klâo hrơi tơdơi Phêtus truh pơ kwar anŭn, mơ̆ng plei Sêsarê ñu đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
And the chief priests and the chief of the Jews laid informations before him against Paul, and besought him, @ Ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing khua wai lăng ƀing Yuđa phong kơ Pôl ƀơi anăp Phêtus. Gơñu rơkâo kơwưh Phêtus 
asking as a grace against him that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying people in wait to kill him on the way. @ rơkâo kơ ñu ngă tơlơi pap brơi arăng ba Pôl pơ plei Yêrusalem, yua kơ gơñu hmâo dưm laih tơlơi mơneč krăp pơdjai Pôl rŏk jơlan. 
Festus therefore answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to set out shortly. @ Phêtus laĭ glaĭ arăng krư̆ Pôl pơ plei Sêsarê, laih anŭn ñu pô mơ̆n či wơ̆t glaĭ tañ pơ anŭn. 
Let therefore the persons of authority among you, says he, going down too, if there be anything in this man, accuse him. @ Phêtus laĭ: “Tui anŭn brơi ƀing khua wai lăng kơ ƀing gih nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng kâo pơ plei Sêsarê, laih anŭn tơdah mơnuih anŭn hmâo tơlơi soh hơgĕt, phong ñu bĕ.”
And having remained among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day, having sat down on the judgment-seat, commanded Paul to be brought. @ Phêtus dŏ hăng gơñu pơ anŭn năng ai sapăn ƀôdah pluh hrơi, ñu trŭn nao pơ plei Sêsarê. Hrơi tơdơi, ñu dŏ ber ƀơi gre phat kơđi laih anŭn ñu pơtă arăng ba Pôl mŭt nao pơ ñu. 
And when he was come, the Jews who were come down from Jerusalem stood round, bringing many and grievous charges which they were not able to prove: @ Tơ Pôl truh laih, ƀing Yuđa mơ̆ng plei Yêrusalem dŏ dơ̆ng jum dar gơ̆ hăng phong kơ gơ̆ lu tơlơi soh prŏng, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơgĕt dưi pơsĭt ôh. 
Paul answering for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I offended [in] anything. @ Pôl pơhiăp pơgang kơ ñu pô: “Kâo ƀu hmâo ngă tơlơi soh hơgĕt pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ hăng Tơlơi Juăt ƀing Yuđa, ƀôdah pơkơdơ̆ng hăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, kŏn pơkơdơ̆ng hăng Sêsar lơi.”
But Festus, desirous of obliging the Jews, to acquire their favour, answering Paul, said, Art thou willing to go up to Jerusalem, there to be judged before me concerning these things? @ Samơ̆ Phêtus kiăng ngă bơmơak kơ ƀing Yuđa, ñu laĭ kơ Pôl: “Ih kiăng đĭ nao pơ Yêrusalem hăng tŭ tơlơi phat kơđi kơ tơlơi arăng phong anai ƀơi anăp kâo pơ anŭn mơ̆?”
But Paul said, I am standing before the judgment-seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews have I done no wrong, as *thou* also very well knowest. @ Pôl laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp sang phat kơđi Sêsar. Jing anih kâo khŏm tŭ tơlơi phat kơđi. Kâo ƀu hmâo ngă soh hăng ƀing Yuđa ôh, kar hăng ih thâo laih. 
If then I have done any wrong and committed anything worthy of death, I do not deprecate dying; but if there is nothing of those things of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar. @ Tơdah sĭt kâo hmâo tơlơi soh hăng tơlơi juăt ƀôdah ngă tơlơi soh hơgĕt lăp kơ djai, kâo ƀu hơngah ôh tŭ tơlơi djai.

Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered, Thou hast appealed to Caesar. To Caesar shalt thou go. @ Tui anŭn, giơ̆ng kơ Phêtus črŏng sai hăng ƀing khua kơčĕ ñu pô, Phêtus laĭ glaĭ kơ Pôl: “Ih iâu đĭ Sêsar phat kơđi; ih či nao pơ Sêsar yơh.”
And when certain days had elapsed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to salute Festus. @ Rơgao ƀiă hrơi mơ̆ng anŭn, pơtao Agripa hăng HʼBêrênis nao pơ Sêsarê kiăng čuă kơkuh kơ Phêtus. 
And when they had spent many days there, Festus laid before the king the matters relating to Paul, saying, There is a certain man left prisoner by Felix, @ Gơñu dŏ glaĭ pơ anŭn sui hrơi, Phêtus ba kơđi Pôl anŭn ruai pơrơđah kơ pơtao Agripa hăng laĭ: “Pơ anai hmâo sa čô mơnă mơ̆ng Phêlik pioh glaĭ. 
concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid informations, requiring judgment against him: @ Hlăk kâo truh pơ Yêrusalem, ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hăng ƀing kŏng tha amăng ƀing Yuđa phong kơ gơ̆ hăng rơkâo kơ kâo klă kơđi kơ gơ̆. 
to whom I answered, It is not [the] custom of the Romans to give up any man before that the accused have the accusers face to face, and he have got opportunity of defence touching the charge. @ Samơ̆ kâo laĭ glaĭ kơ ƀing gơñu ƀing Rôm ƀu phiăn ôh jao brơi sa čô mơnuih hlâo kơ ñu hmâo mông dŏ ƀơi anăp ƀing phong kơ ñu, kiăng pơhiăp pơgang kơ tơlơi arăng phong kơ ñu. 
When therefore they had come together here, without putting it off, I sat the next day on the judgment-seat and commanded the man to be brought: @ Tui anŭn yơh, tơ ƀing gơñu rai pơ anai, kiăng kơ huaĭ rơngiă mông, hrơi tơdơi kâo dŏ ber ƀơi gre phat kơđi pơđar arăng ba rai gơ̆ pơ sang phat kơđi mơtam. 
concerning whom the accusers, standing up, brought no such accusation of guilt as *I* supposed; @ Ƀing phong kơ Pôl leng kơ dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp gre phat kơđi, samơ̆ gơñu ƀu dưi klă kơđi sa mơta tơlơi soh hơgĕt ôh tui hăng kâo pơmĭn. 
but had against him certain questions of their own system of worship, and concerning a certain Jesus who is dead, whom Paul affirmed to be living. @ Ƀing gơñu kơnơ̆ng pơrơjah kơ đơđa mơta tơlơi đaŏ gơñu pô đôč, laih anŭn kơ sa čô pô anăn Yêsu anŭn hmâo djai laih, samơ̆ Pôl khŭt khăt laĭ ăt dŏ hơdip. 
And as I myself was at a loss as to an inquiry into these things, I said, Was he willing to go to Jerusalem and there to be judged concerning these things? @ Yua kơ kâo ƀu thâo ôh hyư̆m khŏm pơkra tơlơi anŭn, hnŭn yơh kâo tơña Pôl tơdah ñu kiăng nao brơi arăng phat kơđi kơ tơlơi anŭn pơ plei Yêrusalem. 
But Paul having appealed to be kept for the cognisance of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I shall send him to Caesar. @ Samơ̆ tơ Pôl rơkâo dŏ glaĭ amăng sang mơnă anŭn dơ̆ng, kiăng kơ Sêsar phat kơđi brơi kơ ñu, hnŭn yơh kâo pơđar arăng wai ñu tơl kâo dưi ba nao ñu pơ Sêsar.”
And Agrippa [said] to Festus, I myself also would desire to hear the man. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him. @ Agripa laĭ kơ Phêtus: “Kâo pô ăt kiăng hmư̆ ñu mơ̆n.” Phêtus laĭ glaĭ: “Pơgi ih či hmư̆ ñu.”
On the morrow therefore, Agrippa being come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and having entered into the hall of audience, with the chiliarchs and the men of distinction of the city, and Festus having given command, Paul was brought. @ Tui anŭn, hrơi tơdơi, pơtao Agripa hăng HʼBêrênis rai hăng tơlơi kơdrưh kơdrŏm, mŭt amăng anih phat kơđi hrŏm hăng ƀing khua gĭt gai tơhan, laih anŭn ƀing khua amăng plei anŭn. Tui hăng Phêtus pơđar, arăng ba rai Pôl. 
And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this person, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews applied to me both in Jerusalem and here, crying out against [him] that he ought not to live any longer. @ Phêtus laĭ: “Ơ Pơtao Agripa hăng abih bang mơnuih dŏ pơ anai. Ƀing gih ƀuh mơnuih anai, yua kơ ñu yơh abih bang ƀing ană plei Yuđa, wơ̆t pơ plei Yêrusalem hăng wơ̆t pơ anai, ur rơkâo kơ kâo anăm brơi ñu dŏ hơdip dơ̆ng ôh. 
But I, having found that he had done nothing worthy of death, and this [man] himself having appealed to Augustus, I have decided to send him; @ Samơ̆ kâo ƀuh gơ̆ ƀu hmâo ngă tơlơi soh hơgĕt lăp kơ djai ôh. Yua kơ gơ̆ pô hmâo rơkâo đĭ Sêsar phat kơđi gơ̆, tui anŭn kâo khư̆p ư ba jao ñu nao pơ anŭn.

Wherefore I have brought him before you, and specially before thee, king Agrippa, so that an examination having been gone into I may have something to write: @ Samơ̆ kâo ƀu thâo klă rơđah ôh kơ tơlơi ñu, kiăng kơ čih ruai pơrơđah đĭ kơ Sêsar.

And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching out his hand answered in his defence: @ Hlăk anŭn pơtao Agripa laĭ kơ Pôl: “Ih dưi pơhiăp kiăng pơgang ih pô.” Tui anŭn Pôl yơr tơngan hăng pơhiăp pơgang ñu pô tui anai:
I count myself happy, king Agrippa, in having to answer to-day before thee concerning all of which I am accused by the Jews, @ “Ơ Pơtao Agripa, kâo pơmĭn kâo hmâo tơlơi mơyun pŭn, yua kơ hrơi anai kâo dưi pơgang kâo pô ƀơi anăp ih kơ abih tơlơi ƀing Yuđa phong kơ kâo.

And often punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme.

And when, [engaged] in this, I was journeying to Damascus, with authority and power from the chief priests, @ “Tui anŭn yơh kâo nao pơ plei Damas hăng tơlơi dưi laih anŭn tơlơi pơđar mơ̆ng ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng.

Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision; @ “Tui anŭn Ơ Pơtao Agripa, kâo ƀu khĭn hơngah ôh kơ tơlơi pơƀuh mơ̆ng adai anŭn. 
but have, first to those both in Damascus and Jerusalem, and to all the region of Judaea, and to the nations, announced that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance. @ Samơ̆ blŭng hlâo kâo pơhaih kơ ƀing dŏ pơ plei Damas, laih anŭn pơ plei Yêrusalem, hăng tar ƀar čar Yuđa, laih anŭn wơ̆t amăng ƀing djuai tuai mơ̆n, pơtô gơñu khŏm kơhmal tơlơi soh hăng wơ̆t glaĭ kơ Ơi Adai, hăng pơrơđah bruă ngă lăp hăng tơlơi gơñu hmâo kơhmal tơlơi soh. 
On account of these things the Jews, having seized me in the temple, attempted to lay hands on and destroy me. @ Yua kơ tơlơi anŭn yơh, ƀing Yuđa mă kâo amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ hăng hơduah kiăng pơdjai kâo. 
Having therefore met with [the] help which is from God, I have stood firm unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying nothing else than those things which both the prophets and Moses have said should happen, @ Samơ̆ Ơi Adai hmâo pơgang kâo laih truh pơ hrơi anai, tui anŭn kâo dŏ dơ̆ng pơ anai ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ ƀing anĕt wơ̆t kơ ƀing prŏng, ƀu pơhiăp hơgĕt tơlơi pơkŏn ôh kơnơ̆ng tơlơi ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo hăng Môis hmâo pơthâo hlâo khŏm truh:

And as he answered for his defence with these things, Festus says with a loud voice, Thou art mad, Paul; much learning turns thee to madness. @ Tơdang Pôl pơhiăp pơgang ñu pô tui anŭn, Phêtus pơhiăp kraih: “Ơ Pôl, ih hưt yơh! Ih hrăm lu đơi tơl ih jing hưt.” 
But Paul said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but utter words of truth and soberness; @ Pôl laĭ glaĭ: “Kâo ƀu hưt ôh, Ơ Ơi Khua Phêtus, kâo pơhiăp tơlơi sĭt biă mă. 
for the king is informed about these things, to whom also I speak with all freedom. For I am persuaded that of these things nothing is hidden from him; for this was not done in a corner. @ Yua kơ pơtao thâo rơđah laih hơdôm tơlơi anai, hnŭn yơh kâo khĭn pơhiăp hăng ih; kâo đaŏ sĭt ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơgĕt ôh pơtao ƀu thâo, yua kơ abih bang tơlơi anai arăng ƀu ngă amăng tơlơi hơgơ̆m ôh. 
King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest. @ Ơ Pơtao Agripa, ih đaŏ mơ̆ kơ ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo? Kâo thâo ih đaŏ.”
And Agrippa [said] to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian. @ Pơtao Agripa laĭ glaĭ kơ Pôl: “Kơnơ̆ng amăng ƀiă mông đôč ih pơmĭn ih dưi ngă brơi kâo jing hĭ sa čô mơnuih đaŏ kơ Krist hă?”
And Paul [said], I would to God, both in little and in much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day, should become such as *I* also am, except these bonds. @ Pôl laĭ glaĭ: “Wơ̆t dah ƀiă ƀôdah sui mông, kâo rơkâo kơ Ơi Adai brơi ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng hơjăn ih đôč ôh, samơ̆ wơ̆t abih bang mơnuih dŏ hmư̆ kâo hrơi anai leng kơ jing kar hăng kâo, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng rơngiao hrĕ čuăk anai đôč.”
And the king stood up, and the governor and Bernice, and those who sat with them, @ Tui anŭn pơtao, khua čar, HʼBêrênis, laih anŭn abih bang ƀing dŏ ber hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing gơñu tơgŭ dơ̆ng soh sel. 
and having gone apart, they spoke to one another saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds. @ Tơdang gơñu tơbiă, gơñu bơlaĭ tơdruă gơñu: “Pô anai ƀu hmâo ngă sa mơta tơlơi soh hơgĕt lăp kơ djai ƀôdah lăp kơ tơlơi krư̆ ôh.” 
And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been let go if he had not appealed to Caesar. @ Pơtao Agripa laĭ kơ Phêtus: “Tơdah ñu aka iâu đĭ tơlơi phat kơđi ƀơi anăp Sêsar, ih dưi phư hĭ ñu.”
But when it had been determined that we should sail to Italy, they delivered up Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion, by name Julius, of Augustus' company. @ Tơ khư̆p ư laih kơ tơlơi brơi gơmơi đĭ kompăn nao pơ čar Itali, arăng jao Pôl hăng đơđa ƀing mơnă pơkŏn kơ sa čô khua tơhan wai sa rơtuh čô anăn ñu Julius amăng phung tơhan sang pơtao Ôgust. 
And going on board a ship of Adramyttium about to navigate by the places along Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us. @ Gơmơi đĭ kompăn mơ̆ng plei Adramit či nao pơ lu drun kompăn jưh kơtuai hang ia rơsĭ kwar Asi, laih anŭn gơmơi nao, hmâo Aristark sa čô mơnuih Masêđôn mơ̆ng plei Têsalônik nao hrŏm hăng gơmơi. 
And the next day we arrived at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and suffered him to go to his friends and refresh himself. @ Hrơi tơdơi kơ anŭn gơmơi truh pơ plei Sidôn laih anŭn Julius ngă hiam kơ Pôl, brơi ñu dưi hyu čuă ƀing giăng mah ñu hăng dưi mă tŭ mơnơ̆ng gơñu djru. 
And setting sail thence we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. @ Mơ̆ng anih anŭn gơmơi đĭ kompăn, yua kơ angĭn klă anăp, gơmơi nao hluai tui ter hang plao ia Čiprơ. 
And having sailed over the waters of Cilicia and Pamphylia we came to Myra in Lycia: @ Giơ̆ng gơmơi găn hĭ ia rơsĭ Silisi hăng Pamphili, gơmơi truh pơ plei Mira amăng čar Lisi. 
and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria sailing to Italy, he made us go on board her. @ Ƀơi anŭn khua tơhan ƀuh kompăn mơ̆ng Aleksandri nao pơ čar Itali, hnŭn yơh ñu brơi gơmơi đĭ kompăn anŭn.
And sailing slowly for many days, and having with difficulty got abreast of Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under the lee of Crete abreast of Salmone; @ Kompăn gơmơi nao rơnang amăng lu hrơi, hăng tơlơi gleh glăn biă mă gơmơi dưi truh plei Kơnit. Yua kơ angĭn klă anăp gơmơi ƀu dưi nao ataih hloh dơ̆ng ôh, hnŭn yơh gơmơi nao ter hang plao ia Kret găn anăp plei Salmôn. 
and coasting it with difficulty we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was [the] city of Lasaea. @ Hăng tơlơi gleh glăn biă mă gơmơi hluai tui hang kuăl ia anŭn, laih anŭn truh pơ sa anih arăng pia Drun Jưh Hiam, jĕ plei prŏng Lasê.
And much time having now been spent, and navigation being already dangerous, because the fast also was already past, Paul counselled them, @ Gơmơi hmâo rơngiă lu hrơi, laih anŭn tơlơi hyu hăng kompăn jing hĭ hyưt pưt biă mă yua kơ hrơi ƀing Yuđa ư̆ ƀơ̆ng huă rơgao hĭ laih, tui anŭn Pôl pơđur kơ gơñu hăng laĭ, 
saying, Men, I perceive that the navigation will be with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives. @ “Ơ ƀing khua, kâo ƀuh tơlơi ƀing ta hyu anai či hmâo tơlơi hyưt pưt laih anŭn lu tơlơi răm rai prŏng, ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng kơ dram gơnam hăng kompăn đôč ôh, samơ̆ wơ̆t kơ tơlơi hơdip ƀing ta mơ̆n.” 
But the centurion believed rather the helmsman and the shipowner than what was said by Paul. @ Samơ̆ khua tơhan gưt kơ pô găt kompăn hăng pô kompăn hloh kơ tơlơi Pôl laĭ. 
And the harbour being ill adapted to winter in, the most counselled to set sail thence, if perhaps they might reach Phoenice to winter in, a port of Crete looking north-east and south-east. @ Yua kơ anih drun jưh anŭn ƀu hiam ôh kơ kompăn dŏ amăng bơyan puih, hnŭn yơh lu mơnuih tŭ ư lui anih anŭn, brơi kompăn gir khŏm nao truh pơ plei Phênik, jing drun jưh ƀơi plao ia Kret, dŏ gah akiăng yŭ kơ dơnŭng hăng yŭ kơ kơdư, kiăng dŏ ƀơi anŭn amăng bơyan puih.
And [the] south wind blowing gently, supposing that they had gained their object, having weighed anchor they sailed close in shore along Crete. @ Hmâo angĭn rơnang čơdơ̆ng thut mơ̆ng dơnŭng, gơñu pơmĭn dưi ngă tui hăng hơdră gơñu hmâo pơkra laih, hnŭn yơh gơñu dui đĭ pơsơi kơ̆ng kompăn hăng nao hluai tui hang plao ia Kret. 
But not long after there came down it a hurricane called Euroclydon. @ Samơ̆ tañ mơtam hmâo angĭn kơtang arăng pia Ơrakilôn mơ̆ng plao ia anŭn hơprah trŭn. 
And the ship being caught and driven, and not able to bring her head to the wind, letting her go we were driven [before it]. @ Angĭn pưh kompăn tơl gơmơi ƀu dưi pơkơdơ̆ng hăng angĭn ôh, tui anŭn gơmơi phư lui măk ai kompăn nao tui hăng angĭn pưh pơđung ñu. 
But running under the lee of a certain island called Clauda, we were with difficulty able to make ourselves masters of the boat; @ Gơmơi găn ƀơi anih kơđap plao ia anĕt arăng pia jing Klôda, laih anŭn hăng tơlơi gleh biă mă kah gơmơi dưi kă sŏng pơklaih. 
which having hoisted up, they used helps, frapping the ship; and fearing lest they should run into Syrtis and run aground, and having lowered the gear they were so driven. @ Giơ̆ng kơ arăng yŏng đĭ sŏng pơklaih, gơñu mă hrĕ hăng kă hĭ jum dar kompăn; laih anŭn yua kơ hwĭ či đom hĭ ƀơi hang čuah Sirtis, gơñu pơtrŭn hĭ khăn kompăn laih anŭn phư lui măk ai angĭn pưh nao. 
But the storm being extremely violent on us, on the next day they threw cargo overboard, @ Hrơi tơdơi kơ anŭn, angĭn rơbŭ ăt dŏ kơtang đôč, tui anŭn gơñu čơdơ̆ng glŏm lui hĭ gơnam tam amăng ia rơsĭ. 
and on the third day with their own hands they cast away the ship furniture. @ Hrơi tal klâo gơñu glŏm hĭ hơdôm mơnơ̆ng kơ kompăn yua amăng ia rơsĭ. 
And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no small storm lying on us, in the end all hope of our being saved was taken away. @ Amăng lu hrơi ƀu ƀuh yang hrơi, kŏn ƀuh pơtŭ lơi, rơbŭ ăt thut kơtang biă mă tơl gơmơi ƀu hmâo dơ̆ng tah tơlơi čang rơmang dưi klaih.
And when they had been a long while without taking food, Paul then standing up in the midst of them said, Ye ought, O men, to have hearkened to me, and not have made sail from Crete and have gained this disaster and loss. @ Sui hrơi laih gơñu ƀu hmâo ƀơ̆ng huă ôh, Pôl tơgŭ tơ̆ng krah gơñu hăng laĭ: “Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, tơdah ƀing gih hmư̆ kâo mơ̆ng blŭng hlâo, anăm tơbiă ôh mơ̆ng plao ia Kret sĭt yơh ƀing ta ƀu tŭ ôh tơlơi răm rai laih anŭn tơlơi rơngiă anai. 
And now I exhort you to be of good courage, for there shall be no loss at all of life of [any] of you, only of the ship. @ Samơ̆ ră anai kâo alum pơđur ƀing ih dŏ kơjăp pran jua bĕ; yua kơ ƀu či hmâo ôh sa čô amăng ƀing gih rơngiă tơlơi hơdip, kơnơ̆ng rơngiă kompăn đôč. 
For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve, stood by me this night, @ Yua kơ mlam tơ̆m brôi Ơi Adai, Pô jing khua kâo laih anŭn Pô kâo kơkuh pơpŭ, pơkiaŏ rai sa čô ling jang Ñu dŏ dơ̆ng jĕ kâo hăng laĭ, 
saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee. @ ‘Ơ Pôl, anăm hwĭ ôh; ih khŏm dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp Sêsar; laih anŭn anai nê, Ơi Adai hmâo pha brơi kơ ih abih bang ƀing mơnuih đĭ kompăn hrŏm hăng ih.’ 
Wherefore be of good courage, men, for I believe God that thus it shall be, as it has been said to me. @ Tui anŭn, Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng dŏ kơjăp pran jua bĕ, yua kơ kâo đaŏ sĭt kơ Ơi Adai hơdôm tơlơi anŭn či truh tui hăng tơlơi Ñu hmâo laĭ laih kơ kâo. 
But we must be cast ashore on a certain island. @ Samơ̆ ƀing ta či đung nao đom hĭ ƀơi sa boh plao ia.”
And when the fourteenth night was come, we being driven about in Adria, towards the middle of the night the sailors supposed that some land neared them, @ Truh mlam tal pluh pă, kompăn gơmơi ăt dŏ đung hyu ƀơi ia rơsĭ Adriatik, amăng tơ̆ng krah mlam ƀing đĭ kompăn mĭn dah gơñu jĕ truh pơ hang. 
and having sounded found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther and having again sounded they found fifteen fathoms; @ Tui anŭn gơñu plĕ trŭn hrĕ boh pơkă laih anŭn thâo boh dlam pă pluh met. Tơdơi ƀiă kơ anŭn gơñu pơkă dơ̆ng hăng thâo boh dlam klâo pluh met. 
and fearing lest we should be cast on rocky places, casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished that day were come. @ Hwĭ jrơ̆m djơ̆ boh pơtâo, hnŭn yơh gơñu mơ̆ng klon kompăn klaih trŭn pă klŏ pơsơi kơ̆ng amăng ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn gơñu iâu laĭ kiăng adai tañ rơđah. 
But the sailors wishing to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat into the sea under pretext of being about to carry out anchors from the prow, @ Samơ̆ ƀing găt kompăn hơduah jơlan kiăng đuaĭ mơ̆ng kompăn, gơñu pơtrŭn sŏng amăng ia rơsĭ gơñu ngă ƀlor nao glŏm pơsơi kơ̆ng ƀơi anăp akŏ kompăn, 
Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these abide in the ship *ye* cannot be saved. @ Pôl laĭ kơ khua tơhan hăng ƀing tơhan: “Tơdah ƀing anai ƀu dŏ amăng kompăn, ƀing gih ƀu dưi klaih ôh.” 
Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let her fall. @ Tui anŭn ƀing tơhan trơĭ hĭ hrĕ akă sŏng anŭn hăng brơi ñu lĕ hĭ amăng ia.
And while it was drawing on to daylight, Paul exhorted them all to partake of food, saying, Ye have passed the fourteenth day watching in expectation without taking food. @ Tơ adai jĕ rơđah, Pôl alum pơđur kơ abih bang mơnuih brơi ƀơ̆ng huă. Ñu laĭ: “Ƀing gih hmâo dŏ tơguan pluh pă hrơi laih, ư̆ ƀu ƀơ̆ng huă đơsĕt ôh. 
Wherefore I exhort you to partake of food, for this has to do with your safety; for not a hair from the head of any one of you shall perish. @ Hnŭn yơh ră anai kâo pơđur ƀing gih ƀơ̆ng huă bĕ, kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi dŏ hơdip; yua kơ ƀu hmâo ôh sa ară ƀuk ƀơi akŏ ƀing gih či rơngiă hĭ.” 
And, having said these things and taken a loaf, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken it began to eat. @ Giơ̆ng laĭ tui anŭn, Pôl mă ƀañ tơpŭng, bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai ƀơi anăp abih bang, laih anŭn čơdơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng yơh. 
And all taking courage, themselves also took food. @ Tui anŭn abih bang gơñu hmâo tơlơi pơđĭ pran jua laih anŭn ƀơ̆ng huă mơ̆n. 
And we were in the ship, all the souls, two hundred and seventy-six. @ Abih bang ƀing gơmơi amăng kompăn anŭn hmâo dua rơtuh tơjuh pluh năm čô. 
And having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea. @ Giơ̆ng gơñu ƀơ̆ng huă trơi laih, gơñu mă glŏm hĭ pơdai tơpŭng amăng ia rơsĭ kiăng kơ kompăn djhul ƀiă.
And when it was day they did not recognise the land; but they perceived a certain bay having a strand, on which they were minded, if they should be able, to run the ship ashore; @ Tơ adai rơđah laih, gơñu ƀu thâo krăn ôh lŏn anŭn, samơ̆ gơñu ƀuh hmâo hŏk ia hăng hang čuah. Gơñu pơmĭn tơdah dưi brơi kompăn nao jưh pơ anŭn. 
and, having cast off the anchors, they left [them] in the sea, at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudders, and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the strand. @ Tui anŭn gơñu trơĭ hĭ hrĕ akă pơsơi kơ̆ng, lui hĭ amăng ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn gơñu kleh hrĕ akă gai găt kompăn. Giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu pơđĭ khăn gah akŏ kompăn brơi angĭn thut kompăn anŭn nao pơ hang. 
And falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground, and the prow having stuck itself fast remained unmoved, but the stern was broken by the force of the waves. @ Samơ̆ kompăn nao djơ̆ ƀơi anih kôl čuah amăng ia, hnŭn yơh kompăn đom hĭ ƀơi anŭn. Akŏ kompăn hơtơ̆p nao amăng čuah, ƀu thâo pơpư̆ tah, bơ kơ klon kompăn ia poh yă klă pơčah hĭ brăk brai.
And [the] counsel of the soldiers was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim off and escape. @ Ƀing tơhan pơmĭn kiăng pơdjai hĭ abih bang ƀing mơnă hwĭ kơ ƀing gơ̆ luai truh hang laih anŭn đuaĭ kơdŏp hĭ. 
But the centurion, desirous of saving Paul, hindered them of their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, casting themselves first [into the sea], to get out on land; @ Samơ̆ khua tơhan kiăng pơklaih Pôl, tui anŭn ñu khă tơlơi pơmĭn gơñu kiăng ngă anŭn. Ñu pơđar kơ ƀing hlơi thâo luai brơi gơñu kơdâo trŭn hlâo hăng luai nao pơ hang. 
and the rest, some on boards, some on some of the things [that came] from the ship; and thus it came to pass that all got safe to land. @ Bơ ƀing ăt dŏ glaĭ či tui klon, đơđa đĭ hơnal tơr, đơđa kuăr ƀơi hơnal kompăn pơčah. Hnŭn yơh abih bang gơñu leng kơ đĭ truh pơ hang hăng tơlơi rơnŭk rơnua.
And when we got safe [to land] we then knew that the island was called Melita. @ Giơ̆ng kơ gơmơi klaih laih, hlăk anŭn gơmơi thâo plao ia anŭn arăng pơanăn ñu Maltơ. 
But the barbarians shewed us no common kindness; for, having kindled a fire, they took us all in because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold. @ Ƀing ană plei plao ia anŭn ngă hiam biă mă kơ gơmơi. Gơñu pơtŏ apui laih anŭn tŭ jum abih bang ƀing gơmơi, yua kơ adai čơdơ̆ng hơjan laih anŭn rơŏt. 
And Paul having gathered a [certain] quantity of sticks together in a bundle and laid [it] on the fire, a viper coming out from the heat seized his hand. @ Pôl duñ sa čơnaŏ djuh glŏm amăng apui, hmâo sa drơi ala tơbăk tơbiă mơ̆ng djuh yua kơ pơ-iă laih anŭn ñu păl ƀơi tơngan Pôl. 
And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom, [though] saved out of the sea, Nemesis has not allowed to live. @ Tơ ƀing ană plei plao ia anŭn ƀuh ala păl ƀơi tơngan Pôl, gơñu pơ laĭ tơdruă: “Sĭt biă mă pô anai jing sa čô pơdjai mơnuih.

*He* however, having shaken off the beast into the fire, felt no harm. @ Samơ̆ Pôl añah hĭ ala anŭn amăng apui, laih anŭn ƀu hmâo tơlơi ruă hơgĕt ôh. 
But *they* expected that he would have swollen or fallen down suddenly dead. But when they had expected a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, changing their opinion, they said he was a god. @ Ƀing anŭn pơmĭn dah drơi jan Pôl či brah đĭ ƀôdah rơbuh djai mơtam.

Now in the country surrounding that place were the lands belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius, who received us and gave [us] hospitality three days in a very friendly way. @ Jĕ pơ anih anŭn hmâo lŏn lơ̆m kơ khua plao ia anŭn anăn ñu Publius.

And it happened that the father of Publius lay ill of fever and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and having prayed and laid his hands on him cured him. @ Hlăk anŭn, ama Publius duăm laih anŭn ruă kian juă glai drah dŏ đih ƀơi sưng. Pôl nao ngui ñu, iâu laĭ ah tơngan ƀơi gơ̆, hăng pơsuaih brơi. 
But this having taken place, the rest also who had sicknesses in the island came and were healed: @ Tơ bruă anai truh, abih bang ƀing ruă pơkŏn amăng plao ia anŭn rai pơ Pôl, laih anŭn dưi suaih soh sel. 
who also honoured us with many honours, and on our leaving they made presents to us of what should minister to our wants. @ Gơñu brơi lu mơnơ̆ng kơ gơmơi, laih anŭn tơ gơmơi đĭ kompăn đuaĭ nao, gơñu brơi kơ gơmơi djŏp mơta mơnơ̆ng gơmơi kiăng.

And it came to pass after three days, that he called together those who were the chief of the Jews; and when they had come together he said to them, Brethren, *I* having done nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers, have been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans, @ Rơgao kơ klâo hrơi, Pôl jak iâu ƀing khua ană Yuđa rai.

Because, knowing God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened: @ Yua kơ wơ̆t dah gơñu thâo krăn laih Ơi Adai, gơñu ăt ƀu pơpŭ pơyom ôh kơ Ñu jing Ơi Adai, kŏn bơni hơơč kơ Ñu lơi; samơ̆ tơlơi pơmĭn gơñu jing hĭ đôč đač, laih anŭn pran jua mlŭk gơñu bă hăng tơlơi kơnăm mơmŏt.

Wherefore God gave them up [also] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves: @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh Ơi Adai jao lui hĭ gơñu kơ tơlơi grĭ grañ tui hăng pran jua gơñu amoaih hưp, tơl gơñu yua drơi jan gơñu pô ngă tơlơi pơmlâo hañ tơdruă gơñu.

For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature; @ Yua kơ tơlơi anŭn yơh Ơi Adai hmâo jao hĭ gơñu kơ tơlơi amoaih rih mlâo hañ.

and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit. @ Ƀing đah rơkơi ăt kar kaĭ mơ̆n, lui hĭ tơlơi phiăn yang đar đah rơkơi hăng đah kơmơi juăt ngă, laih anŭn pơčuh tơlơi amoaih rih tơdruă, đah rơkơi hăng đah rơkơi ngă tơlơi soh mlâo hañ, laih anŭn gơñu pô tŭ mă tơlơi pơkơhmal lăp hăng tơlơi soh gơñu.
And according as they did not think good to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things; @ Yua kơ gơñu ƀu kiăng djă pioh ôh tơlơi thâo krăn Ơi Adai, tui anŭn Ơi Adai hmâo jao lui hĭ gơñu kơ tơlơi pơmĭn răm ƀăm tơl gơñu ngă lu tơlơi ƀu lăp.

But if our unrighteousness commend God's righteousness, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who inflicts wrath?

their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; asps' poison [is] under their lips: @  “Rơkong đŏk gơñu kar hăng pơsat arăng pŏk lui;

there is no fear of God before their eyes. @ “Gơñu ƀu hwĭ pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai ôh.”
Now we know that whatever the things the law says, it speaks to those under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world be under judgment to God. @ Ƀing ta thâo hơgĕt khul tơlơi juăt hmâo pơhiăp, ñu laĭ kơ ƀing dŏ gah yŭ tơlơi juăt, kiăng kơ abih bang amăng bah khŏm dŏ rơiăt, laih anŭn abih bang mơnuih dŏ ƀơi lŏn tơnah leng kơ dŏ gah yŭ kơ tơlơi Ơi Adai phat kơđi. 
Wherefore by works of law no flesh shall be justified before him; for by law [is] knowledge of sin. @ Yua kơ ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô mơnuih dưi hmâo tơlơi yap tơpă yua mơ̆ng bruă ngă tui tơlơi juăt, yua mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt yơh arăng thâo krăn tơlơi soh.
But now without law righteousness of God is manifested, borne witness to by the law and the prophets; @ Samơ̆ ră anai tơlơi tơpă Ơi Adai hmâo bơrơđah laih gah rơngiao tơlơi juăt; tơlơi anai, tơlơi juăt wơ̆t hăng ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo hmâo pơhaih pơsĭt brơi laih.

whom God has set forth a mercy-seat, through faith in his blood, for [the] shewing forth of his righteousness, in respect of the passing by the sins that had taken place before, through the forbearance of God; @ Ơi Adai ruah laih Yêsu Krist brơi Ñu jing mơnơ̆ng ngă yang song mă tơlơi soh hăng drah Ñu, brơi kơ hlơi pô mă tŭ hăng tơlơi đaŏ.

Where then [is] boasting? It has been excluded. By what law? of works? Nay, but by law of faith; @ Tui anŭn hmâo hơgĕt dưi pơang pô mơ̆? Ƀu dưi ôh! Hăng tơlơi juăt hơgĕt? Hăng tơlơi juăt bruă ngă mơ̆? Ƀu djơ̆ ôh, samơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi ƀing ta đaŏ.

Is [God] the God of Jews only? is he not of [the] nations also? Yea, of nations also: @ Ƀôdah djơ̆ mơ̆ Ơi Adai jing Ơi Adai kơnơ̆ng kơ ƀing Yuđa đôč? Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă Ñu ăt jing Ơi Adai wơ̆t kơ ƀing djuai tuai mơ̆n? Sĭt yơh, Ñu jing Ơi Adai wơ̆t kơ ƀing djuai tuai mơ̆n, 
since indeed [it is] one God who shall justify [the] circumcision on the principle of faith, and uncircumcision by faith. @ Yua kơ Ơi Adai jing hasa đôč. Ñu či yap tơpă kơ ƀing khăt klĭ hăng tơlơi đaŏ laih anŭn ƀing ƀu khăt klĭ ăt hăng tơlơi đaŏ anŭn mơ̆n. 
Do we then make void law by faith? Far be the thought: [no,] but we establish law. @ Tui anŭn hăng tơlơi đaŏ ƀing ta lơ̆m lui hĭ tơlơi juăt mơ̆? Ư ưh, ƀu djơ̆ ôh! Samơ̆ kơđai glaĭ, ƀing ta ngă pơkơjăp tơlơi juăt.
What shall we say then that Abraham our father according to flesh has found? @ Tui anŭn, hơgĕt ƀing ta či laĭ djơ̆ kơ Abraham ơi adon ƀing ta gah kơ asar đeh, hơgĕt ñu hmâo mă tŭ? 
For if Abraham has been justified on the principle of works, he has whereof to boast: but not before God; @ Tơdah Abraham hmâo tơlơi yap tơpă mơ̆ng bruă ñu ngă, ñu hmâo tơlơi dưi pơang ñu pô. Samơ̆ ñu ƀu dưi ôh pơang ñu pô ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai. 
for what does the scripture say? And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. @ Yua kơ hơgĕt Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp laĭ? “Abraham đaŏ kơ Ơi Adai, laih anŭn yua mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ anŭn yơh Ơi Adai hmâo yap ñu tơpă.” 
Now to him that works the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but of debt: @ Kơ mơnuih mă bruă, prăk apah ñu ƀu djơ̆ jing tơlơi pha brơi ôh, samơ̆ yap kar hăng hơnưh. 
but to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is reckoned as righteousness. @ Bơ kơ hlơi pô ƀu mă bruă ôh, samơ̆ đaŏ kơ Pô yap tơpă brơi kơ mơnuih soh, tơlơi đaŏ mơnuih anŭn hmâo yap jing tơpă. 
Even as David also declares the blessedness of the man to whom God reckons righteousness without works: @ Kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n, Đawit pơhiăp tơlơi mơyun hiam kơ mơnuih Ơi Adai yap tơpă ƀu djơ̆ yua mơ̆ng bruă ngă ôh:
Blessed [they] whose lawlessnesses have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered: @ “Mơyun hiam yơh kơ hlơi pô Ơi Adai pap brơi laih tơlơi ngă gao ñu,
Tơlơi soh ñu Ơi Adai hmâo lơ̆m lui hĭ laih.
blessed [the] man to whom [the] Lord shall not at all reckon sin. @ Mơyun hiam yơh kơ mơnuih Khua Yang ƀu yap ôh tơlơi soh ñu.”
[Does] this blessedness then [rest] on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For we say that faith has been reckoned to Abraham as righteousness. @ Djơ̆ mơ̆ tơlơi mơyun hiam anŭn kơnơ̆ng kơ ƀing khăt klĭ đôč, ƀôdah wơ̆t kơ ƀing ƀu khăt klĭ? Ƀing ta laĭ yua mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ Abraham Ơi Adai yap ñu jing tơpă. 
How then has it been reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision. @ Tui anŭn hơbin Ơi Adai hmâo yap tơlơi anŭn kơ ñu? Hlâo kơ ñu khăt klĭ ƀôdah tơdơi kơ ñu khăt klĭ? Ƀu djơ̆ tơdơi ôh samơ̆ hlâo kơ ñu khăt klĭ yơh. 
And he received [the] sign of circumcision [as] seal of the righteousness of faith which [he had] being in uncircumcision, that he might be [the] father of all them that believe being in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned to them also; @ Ñu hmâo mă tŭ laih tơlơi khăt klĭ jing gru kơnăl kar hăng mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm tơlơi tơpă ñu hmâo laih mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ hlăk ñu aka khăt klĭ ôh. Tui anŭn, Abraham jing hĭ ama gah bơngăt kơ abih bang ƀing mơnuih đaŏ samơ̆ ƀu khăt klĭ ôh, laih anŭn gơñu ăt hmâo tơlơi yap tơpă mơ̆n. 
and father of circumcision, not only to those who are of [the] circumcision, but to those also who walk in the steps of the faith, during uncircumcision, of our father Abraham. @ Laih anŭn ñu ăt jing ama kơ ƀing khăt klĭ mơ̆n, jing ƀing ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng khăt klĭ đôč ôh, samơ̆ gơñu hơdip kar hăng tơlơi đaŏ Abraham, ơi adon ƀing ta hmâo hơdip laih hlâo kơ ñu khăt klĭ.
For [it was] not by law that the promise was to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of [the] world, but by righteousness of faith. @  Tơlơi Ơi Adai ƀuăn kơ Abraham hăng kơ ƀing ană tơčo ñu, brơi ñu mă tŭ lŏn tơnah jing kong ngăn, ƀu djơ̆ yua mơ̆ng tơlơi ñu gưt tơlơi juăt ôh, samơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi tơpă mơ̆ng tơlơi ñu đaŏ. 
For if they which [are] of law be heirs, faith is made vain, and the promise made of no effect. @ Yua kơ tơdah mơ̆ng tơlơi gưt kơ tơlơi juăt kah arăng dưi mă tŭ kong ngăn, tui anŭn tơlơi đaŏ jing hĭ đôč đač laih anŭn tơlơi ƀuăn jing ƀu tŭ yua ôh. 
For law works wrath; but where no law is neither [is there] transgression. @ Yua kơ tơlơi juăt ba rai tơlơi hil, samơ̆ pơpă anih ƀu hmâo tơlơi juăt, pơ anŭn ăt ƀu hmâo tơlơi gao tơlơi juăt ôh.
Therefore [it is] on the principle of faith, that [it might be] according to grace, in order to the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that only which [is] of the law, but to that also which [is] of Abraham's faith, who is father of us all, @ Yua kơ anŭn, mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ yơh tơlơi ƀuăn tơbiă mơ̆ng tơlơi pap či dưi truh sĭt kơ abih bang ană tơčo Abraham, ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng kơ ană tơčo gah yŭ kơ tơlơi juăt đôč ôh, samơ̆ wơ̆t kơ abih bang ană tơčo gah kơ tơlơi đaŏ Abraham.

(according as it is written, I have made thee father of many nations,) before the God whom he believed, who quickens the dead, and calls the things which be not as being; @ Kar hăng hră Ơi Adai hmâo čih laih: “Kâo hmâo pơjing ih jing ama kơ lu djuai mơnuih.” Tui anŭn tơlơi ƀuăn anŭn ăt dŏ tŭ yua ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai, Pô ñu đaŏ, jing Pô brơi tơlơi hơdip kơ ƀing djai, laih anŭn pơjing mơnơ̆ng mơ̆ng mơnơ̆ng aka hmâo hlâo ôh.

and not being weak in faith, he considered not his own body already become dead, being about a hundred years old, and the deadening of Sarah's womb, @ Ñu ƀuh drơi jan ñu jĕ či djai yua kơ ñu giăm hmâo sa rơtuh thŭn laih, laih anŭn ƀuh HʼSara ƀu dưi tơkeng dơ̆ng ôh, samơ̆ tơlơi đaŏ ñu ƀu tơdu ôh. 
and hesitated not at the promise of God through unbelief; but found strength in faith, giving glory to God; @ Ñu ƀu đing ôh kơ tơlơi Ơi Adai ƀuăn, samơ̆ jing kơtang hloh dơ̆ng amăng tơlơi đaŏ laih anŭn pơpŭ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai.

wherefore also it was reckoned to him as righteousness. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh Ơi Adai yap tơlơi ñu đaŏ jing tơlơi tơpă kơ ñu. 
Now it was not written on his account alone that it was reckoned to him, @ Samơ̆ boh pơhiăp “Ơi Adai yap tơlơi tơpă kơ ñu” arăng ƀu kơnơ̆ng čih kơ hơjăn ñu đôč ôh,

For this [cause], even as by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death; and thus death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: @  Hnŭn yơh, kar hăng tơlơi soh hmâo mŭt laih amăng lŏn tơnah yua mơ̆ng sa čô mơnuih, laih anŭn mơ̆ng tơlơi soh tơbiă rai tơlơi djai.

but death reigned from Adam until Moses, even upon those who had not sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is [the] figure of him to come. @ Wơ̆t dah tơlơi djai hmâo wai lăng čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng rơnŭk Ađam truh pơ rơnŭk Môis, wơ̆t kơ ƀing ƀu ngă soh ôh kar hăng mơta tơlơi soh Ađam. Ađam jing rup pơhmô kơ Pô khŏm rai.
But [shall] not the act of favour [be] as the offence? For if by the offence of one the many have died, much rather has the grace of God, and the free gift in grace, which [is] by the one man Jesus Christ, abounded unto the many. @ Samơ̆ tơlơi pha brơi đôč ƀu jing kar hăng tơlơi soh Ađam ôh. Yua kơ tơdah lu mơnuih djai laih yua mơ̆ng tơlơi soh sa čô mơnuih, hloh kơ anŭn dơ̆ng tơlơi Ơi Adai pap laih anŭn tơlơi pha brơi đôč hăng tơlơi pap mơ̆ng sa čô, Yêsu Krist, či truh rơbeh blai kơ lu mơnuih. 
And [shall] not as by one that has sinned [be] the gift? For the judgment [was] of one to condemnation, but the act of favour, of many offences unto justification. @ Laih anŭn tơlơi pha brơi đôč ƀu djơ̆ kar hăng boh than mơ̆ng sa čô mơnuih soh ôh.

For if by the offence of the one death reigned by the one, much rather shall those who receive the abundance of grace, and of the free gift of righteousness, reign in life by the one Jesus Christ:) @ Tơdah yua kơ tơlơi soh mơ̆ng sa čô mơnuih đôč, tơlơi djai hmâo wai lăng laih abih bang yua kơ mơ̆ng sa čô mơnuih anŭn, ăt kar kaĭ mơ̆n yua kơ mơ̆ng sa čô Mơnuih jing Yêsu Krist brơi kơ ƀing hlơi mă tŭ tơlơi pap laih anŭn tơlơi pha brơi đôč tơlơi yap tơpă rơbeh blai, či wai lăng amăng tơlơi hơdip kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n.
so then as [it was] by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life. @ Tui anŭn, kar hăng mơ̆ng tơlơi sa čô mơnuih ngă soh ba truh tơlơi klă kơđi kơ abih bang mơnuih, ăt kar kaĭ mơ̆n mơ̆ng sa mơta bruă tơpă sa čô mơnuih ngă ba truh tơlơi yap tơpă laih anŭn tơlơi hơdip kơ abih bang mơnuih. 
For as indeed by the disobedience of the one man the many have been constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted righteous. @ Yua kơ kar hăng mơ̆ng tơlơi sa čô mơnuih ƀu gưt hiăp, abih bang mơnuih jing hĭ mơnuih soh; ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n, yua mơ̆ng tơlơi sa čô mơnuih gưt hiăp, lu mơnuih či jing hĭ tơpă hơnơ̆ng.

in order that, even as sin has reigned in [the power of] death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. @ Tui anŭn kar hăng tơlơi soh gĭt gai hăng tơlơi djai, ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n tơlơi pap dưi wai lăng hăng tơlơi tơpă laih anŭn ba ƀing ta truh kơ tơlơi hơdip hlŏng lar amăng Yêsu Krist Khua Yang ƀing ta.

We have been buried therefore with him by baptism unto death, in order that, even as Christ has been raised up from among [the] dead by the glory of the Father, so *we* also should walk in newness of life. @ Tui anŭn, hăng tơlơi ƀatem Ơi Adai hmâo dơr laih ƀing ta hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu amăng tơlơi djai Ñu.

knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with [him], that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin. @ Ƀing ta thâo kơ mơnuih hơđăp ƀing ta hmâo pơ̆ng laih ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu, kiăng kơ drơi jan soh sat dưi răm rai hĭ, tui anŭn ƀing ta ƀu jing hlŭn kơ tơlơi soh dơ̆ng ôh. 
For he that has died is justified from sin. @ Yua kơ hlơi pô hmâo djai laih ñu jing klaih rơngai laih mơ̆ng tơlơi soh. 
Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him, @ Samơ̆ tơdah ƀing ta hmâo djai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Krist laih, ƀing ta đaŏ ƀing ta či hơdip hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu mơ̆n.

For in that he has died, he has died to sin once for all; but in that he lives, he lives to God. @ Yua kơ Ñu hmâo djai, anŭn jing tơlơi djai kơ tơlơi soh kơnơ̆ng sa wơ̆t djŏp laih; samơ̆ Ñu hơdip, jing Ñu hơdip kơ Ơi Adai.

Neither yield your members instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but yield yourselves to God as alive from among [the] dead, and your members instruments of righteousness to God. @ Anăm jao lui sa črăn amăng drơi jan ƀing gih kơ tơlơi soh ôh kiăng jing hĭ gơnam yua brơi kơ tơlơi soh sat, samơ̆ jao bĕ ƀing gih pô kơ Ơi Adai jing kar hăng ƀing mơnuih hơdip glaĭ laih mơ̆ng tơlơi djai, laih anŭn jao bĕ črăn amăng drơi jan ƀing gih jing gơnam yua brơi kơ tơlơi tơpă.

But thanks [be] to God, that ye were bondmen of sin, but have obeyed from the heart the form of teaching into which ye were instructed. @ Samơ̆ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai, yua kơ hlăk hlâo adih ƀing gih hmâo jing hlŭn kơ tơlơi soh, samơ̆ ră anai hăng abih pran jua ƀing gih čơdơ̆ng tui gưt laih kơ mơta tơlơi pơtô kơ ƀing gih kơ tơlơi jao ƀing gih pô.

I speak humanly on account of the weakness of your flesh. For even as ye have yielded your members in bondage to uncleanness and to lawlessness unto lawlessness, so now yield your members in bondage to righteousness unto holiness. @ Kâo pơhiăp tui hăng ană mơnuih yua kơ tơlơi thâo hluh ƀing gih jing đêl.

For when ye were bondmen of sin ye were free from righteousness. @ Tơdang ƀing gih ăt dŏ jing hlŭn kơ tơlơi soh, ƀing gih jing rơngai kơ tơlơi tơpă. 
What fruit therefore had ye *then* in the things of which ye are *now* ashamed? for the end of *them* [is] death. @ Hlăk anŭn, hơgĕt boh tŭ yua ƀing gih hmâo mơ̆ng tơlơi ƀing gih ngă anŭn tơl ră anai ƀing gih dŏ tŭ tơlơi mlâo hañ? Hnal tuč kơ tơlơi anŭn jing tơlơi djai.

Are ye ignorant, brethren, (for I speak to those knowing law,) that law rules over a man as long as he lives? @ Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, kâo pơhiăp hăng ƀing thâo tơlơi juăt, ƀing gih ƀu thâo ôh hă tơlơi juăt kơnơ̆ng wai lăng ƀơi sa čô mơnuih hlăk ñu dŏ hơdip đôč? 
For the married woman is bound by law to her husband so long as he is alive; but if the husband should die, she is clear from the law of the husband: @ Tui anŭn tui hăng tơlơi juăt, đah kơmơi đom hăng rơkơi ñu tơdang ñu hlăk dŏ hơdip; samơ̆ tơ rơkơi ñu djai laih, ñu klaih rơngai yơh mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt akă ñu hăng rơkơi ñu. 
so then, the husband being alive, she shall be called an adulteress if she be to another man; but if the husband should die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, though she be to another man. @ Hnŭn yơh tơdang rơkơi ñu ăt dŏ hơdip tơdah đah kơmơi anŭn dŏ hĭ rơkơi pơkŏn, arăng či iâu ñu đah kơmơi gao akŏ.

So that, my brethren, *ye* also have been made dead to the law by the body of the Christ, to be to another, who has been raised up from among [the] dead, in order that we might bear fruit to God. @ Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, kar hăng tui anŭn mơ̆n, amăng drơi jan Krist ƀing gih djai laih gah kơ tơlơi juăt laih anŭn ră anai ƀing gih lơ̆m kơ pô pơkŏn laih, Pô Ơi Adai hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ laih mơ̆ng ƀing djai, kiăng kơ ƀing ta dưi mơboh kơ Ơi Adai. 
For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, which [were] by the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit to death; @ Tơdang ƀing ta ăt dŏ hơdip amăng asar đeh, khul tơlơi amoaih hưp kơ tơlơi soh mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt pơtrŭt pơsur, mă bruă amăng drơi jan ƀing ta, hnal tuč ba kơ tơlơi djai. 
but now we are clear from the law, having died in that in which we were held, so that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter. @ Samơ̆ ră anai ƀing ta dưi klaih rơngai laih mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt, ƀing ta hmâo djai laih gah kơ tơlơi juăt hmâo pơjing ƀing ta ngă hlŭn, kiăng kơ ƀing ta mă bruă tui hăng tơlơi hơdip phrâo mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam, ƀu djơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi juăt hơđăp kơ tơlơi čih amăng hră mơar dơ̆ng tah.
What shall we say then? [is] the law sin? Far be the thought. But I had not known sin, unless by law: for I had not had conscience also of lust unless the law had said, Thou shalt not lust; @ Tui anŭn hơgĕt ƀing ta či laĭ lĕ? Djơ̆ mơ̆ tơlơi juăt jing tơlơi soh? Ƀu djơ̆ tui anŭn ôh! Samơ̆ tơdah ƀu hmâo ôh tơlơi juăt, kâo ƀu dưi thâo krăn tơlơi soh ôh. Kâo ƀu či thâo krăn ôh hơgĕt tơlơi hưp ham jing tơdah tơlơi juăt ƀu laĭ: “Anăm hưp ham ôh.”

Did then that which is good become death to me? Far be the thought. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death to me by that which is good; in order that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. @ Tui anŭn, djơ̆ mơ̆ tơlơi hiam ba tơlơi djai kơ kâo?

For I delight in the law of God according to the inward man: @ Amăng lăm pran jua kâo, kâo hơ̆k mơak kơ tơlơi juăt Ơi Adai;

Samơ̆ ƀing hơdip tui hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam, khăp pơmĭn kơ khul tơlơi Yang Bơngăt Hiam kiăng. 
For the mind of the flesh [is] death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace. @ Khăp pơmĭn kơ tơlơi tui hăng asar đeh ba kơ tơlơi djai. Samơ̆ tơlơi khăp pơmĭn kơ tơlơi tui hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam ba kơ tơlơi hơdip laih anŭn tơlơi rơnŭk rơnua. 
Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be: @ Yua kơ tơlơi khăp pơmĭn gah kơ asar đeh jing ayăt hăng Ơi Adai. Ñu ƀu tui gưt kơ tơlơi juăt Ơi Adai ôh, kŏn ñu dưi tui gưt lơi. 
and they that are in flesh cannot please God. @ Ƀing hlơi hơdip tui hăng asar đeh ƀu dưi bơmơak kơ Ơi Adai ôh.
But *ye* are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God's Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ *he* is not of him: @ Tui anŭn tơdah sĭt biă mă Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ơi Adai dŏ amăng ƀing gih, ƀing gih ƀu hơdip tui hăng asar đeh dơ̆ng ôh samơ̆ tui hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam. Hlơi pô ƀu hmâo Yang Bơngăt Hiam Krist, ñu ƀu lơ̆m kơ Krist ôh. 
but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness. @ Samơ̆ tơdah Krist dŏ amăng ƀing gih, wơ̆t dah drơi jan ƀing gih djai yua kơ tơlơi soh, bơngăt ƀing gih ăt hơdip yua mơ̆ng tơlơi tơpă. 
But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you. @ Tơdah Yang Bơngăt Hiam kơ Pô hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ laih Yêsu Krist mơ̆ng ƀing djai dŏ amăng ƀing gih, Pô hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ laih Yêsu Krist mơ̆ng ƀing djai ăt či pơhơdip glaĭ drơi jan thâo djai ƀing gih kar kaĭ mơ̆n yua mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam dŏ amăng ƀing gih.
So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh; @ Tui anŭn, Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, ƀing ta ƀu đom hơnưh kơ asar đeh dơ̆ng tah kiăng kơ hơdip tui hăng asar đeh. 
for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live: @ Yua kơ tơdah ƀing gih hơdip tui hăng asar đeh, ƀing gih či djai; samơ̆ tơdah ƀing gih kơnang kơ Yang Bơngăt Hiam ƀing gih pơdjai hĭ bruă asar đeh, ƀing gih či hơdip yơh. 
for as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, *these* are sons of God. @ Yua kơ abih bang ƀing hlơi hmâo Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ơi Adai dui ba leng kơ jing ƀing ană Ơi Adai. 
For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. @ Yua kơ ƀing gih ƀu tŭ mă ôh bơngăt jua brơi ƀing gih jing hlŭn kiăng kơ ăt dŏ hơdip nanao amăng tơlơi hwĭ; samơ̆ ƀing gih hmâo tŭ mă laih Yang Bơngăt Hiam brơi jing ană rong. Yua anŭn yơh ƀing ta iâu “Aba, Ama!” 
The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God. @ Yang Bơngăt Hiam pô yơh ngă pơsĭt kơ bơngăt jua ƀing ta kơ tơlơi ƀing ta jing ană Ơi Adai. 
And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ's joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him]. @ Tơdah ƀing ta jing ană bă, ƀing ta ăt jing ƀing tŭ mă kong ngăn mơ̆n, ƀing tŭ mă kong ngăn Ơi Adai, laih anŭn ƀing tŭ mă kong ngăn hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Krist, sĭt biă mă tơdah ƀing ta tŭ tơlơi ruă tơnap hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu, ƀing ta ăt či dưi hmâo tơlơi ang yang hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu kar kaĭ mơ̆n.
For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed to us. @ Kâo pơmĭn khul tơlơi ruă tơnap rơnŭk anai ƀu năng lăp ôh bơkơnar hăng tơlơi ang yang či pơrơđah brơi kơ ƀing ta rơnŭk tơdơi. 
For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God: @ Yua kơ abih bang mơnơ̆ng mơnuă Ơi Adai hrih leng kơ hur har, čang rơmang biă mă kơ hrơi ƀing ană bă Ơi Adai či pơrơđah rai. 
for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope @ Yua kơ abih bang mơnơ̆ng mơnuă, hmâo tŭ tơlơi brŭ rai đôč đač, ƀu djơ̆ tui hăng gơñu pô kiăng ôh, samơ̆ tui hăng Pô brơi gơñu tŭ tơlơi anŭn hăng tơlơi čang rơmang

And not only [that], but even *we* ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is] the redemption of our body. @ ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng kơ khul mơnơ̆ng mơnuă hmâo hrih laih đôč ôh, samơ̆ wơ̆t kơ ƀing ta pô mơ̆n, ƀing hmâo laih boh tal blŭng mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam.

For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what any one sees, why does he also hope? @ Yua kơ amăng tơlơi čang rơmang yơh ƀing ta hmâo tơlơi pơklaih. Samơ̆ tơdah tơlơi čang rơmang hmâo ƀuh laih, ñu ƀu jing tơlơi čang rơmang dơ̆ng tah. Yua kơ hlơi pô dŏ čang rơmang kơ mơnơ̆ng ñu ƀuh laih?

And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered. @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n Yang Bơngăt Hiam djru ƀing ta amăng tơlơi tơdu ƀing ta, yua kơ ƀing ta ƀu thâo ôh hyư̆m či iâu laĭ kiăng kơ djơ̆, samơ̆ Yang Bơngăt Hiam pô djru iâu laĭ pơala kơ ƀing ta hăng tơlơi kơwưh krao amăng pran jua ƀu thâo pơblang ôh. 
But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God. @ Laih anŭn Ơi Adai jing pô lăng kơsem pran jua mơnuih, thâo tơlơi pơmĭn Yang Bơngăt Hiam. Yua kơ Yang Bơngăt Hiam iâu laĭ pơala brơi ƀing rơgoh hiam tui hăng tơlơi Ơi Adai kiăng.
But we *do* know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose. @ Ƀing ta thâo laih, abih bang tơlơi pơƀŭt glaĭ leng kơ jing hĭ tơlơi hiam kơ ƀing khăp kơ Ơi Adai, jing kơ ƀing mơnuih Ơi Adai hmâo iâu mă tui hăng tơlơi Ñu ruah mă hlâo. 
Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be [the] firstborn among many brethren. @ Yua kơ ƀing mơnuih Ñu thâo laih mơ̆ng hlâo, ăt Ñu hmâo pơkă pioh laih kơ ƀing gơñu dưi jing kar hăng rup Ană Ñu, kiăng kơ Ană Ñu jing ayŏng tha kơ lu ƀing adơi ayŏng. 
But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified. @ Laih anŭn ƀing hlơi Ñu hmâo pơkă pioh laih, Ñu hmâo iâu laih mơ̆n, laih anŭn ƀing hlơi Ñu hmâo iâu laih, Ñu hmâo yap tơpă hơnơ̆ng laih mơ̆n, laih anŭn ƀing hlơi Ñu hmâo yap tơpă hơnơ̆ng laih, ăt Ñu hmâo brơi laih mơ̆n tơlơi ang yang kơ ƀing gơ̆.
What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who against us? @ Tui anŭn, hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing ta či laĭ kơ khul tơlơi anai lĕ? Tơdah Ơi Adai dŏ gah kơ ƀing ta, hlơi pô dưi pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ hăng ƀing ta dơ̆ng?

What then shall we say? That [they of the] nations, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained righteousness, but [the] righteousness that is on the principle of faith. @ Tui anŭn hơgĕt ƀing ta či laĭ lĕ?

For Moses lays down in writing the righteousness which is of the law, The man who has practised those things shall live by them. @ Pơhiăp djơ̆ kơ tơlơi tơpă tơbiă rai mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt, Môis čih tui anai: “Hlơi pô gưt abih tơlơi juăt, yua kơ mơ̆ng tơlơi anŭn ñu či hơdip.” 
But the righteousness of faith speaks thus: Do not say in thine heart, Who shall ascend to the heavens? that is, to bring Christ down; @ Samơ̆ tơlơi tơpă tơbiă rai mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ laĭ tui anai: “Anăm laĭ ôh amăng pran jua ih, Hlơi či đĭ nao pơ adai?” (Jing, kiăng ba Krist trŭn) 
or, Who shall descend into the abyss? that is, to bring up Christ from among [the] dead. @ ƀôdah “Hlơi či trŭn nao pơ hlŭng dlam?” (Jing, kiăng ba Krist hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng mơnuih djai). 
But what says it? The word is near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach: @ Samơ̆ hơgĕt tơlơi ñu laĭ?
“Boh Pơhiăp dŏ jĕ ih,
Dŏ ƀơi amăng bah ih laih anŭn amăng pran jua ih”
Anŭn jing Boh Pơhiăp kơ tơlơi đaŏ, tơlơi gơmơi pơtô. 
that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from among [the] dead, thou shalt be saved. @ Yua kơ tơdah amăng bah ih pơhaih Yêsu jing Khua Yang, laih anŭn pran jua đaŏ kơ tơlơi Ơi Adai hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ Ñu mơ̆ng tơlơi djai, ih či klaih yơh. 
For with [the] heart is believed to righteousness; and with [the] mouth confession made to salvation. @ Yua kơ hăng pran jua đaŏ, ƀing ta dưi hmâo tơlơi yap tơpă; laih anŭn hăng amăng bah pơhaih, ƀing ta dưi hmâo tơlơi pơklaih. 
For the scripture says, No one believing on him shall be ashamed. @ Hră Ơi Adai pơhiăp čih: “Hlơi pô đaŏ kơ Ñu ƀu či hmâo tơlơi mlâo hañ ôh.” 
For there is no difference of Jew and Greek; for the same Lord of all [is] rich towards all that call upon him. @ Yua kơ ƀu hmâo tơlơi pơkah pơpha ôh tơ̆ng krah ƀing Yuđa hăng ƀing Grek. Yua kơ gơñu hmâo hrŏm hơbĭt kơnơ̆ng hasa Khua Yang jing Khua Yang kơ abih bang mơnuih. Pô pha brơi tơlơi pap rơbeh blai kơ hlơi pô iâu laĭ kơ Ñu. 
For every one whosoever, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved. @ Yua kơ “hlơi iâu kơwưh kơ anăn Khua Yang či dưi klaih.”
How then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe on him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without one who preaches? @ Samơ̆ hyư̆m gơñu dưi iâu laĭ kơ Ơi Adai tơdah gơñu aka đaŏ ôh? Hyư̆m gơñu dưi đaŏ kơ Ơi Adai tơdah gơñu aka hmư̆ ôh? Laih anŭn hyư̆m gơñu dưi hmư̆ tơdah ƀu hmâo mơnuih hyu pơtô? 
and how shall they preach unless they have been sent? according as it is written, How beautiful the feet of them that announce glad tidings of peace, of them that announce glad tidings of good things! @ Laih anŭn hyư̆m mơnuih dưi pơtô tơdah arăng ƀu pơkiaŏ nao gơñu ôh? Tui hăng Boh Pơhiăp Ơi Adai hmâo čih “Hiam rŏ yơh kơ plă tơkai ƀing mơnuih nao pơhaih Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam!” 
But they have not all obeyed the glad tidings. For Esaias says, Lord, who has believed our report? @ Samơ̆ ƀu djơ̆ ôh abih bang ƀing gơñu tŭ mă Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam; yua kơ Êsai laĭ: “Ơ Khua Yang hlơi đaŏ kơ tơlơi gơmơi pơtô?” 
So faith then [is] by a report, but the report by God's word. @ Tui anŭn, tơlơi đaŏ tơbiă rai mơ̆ng tơlơi arăng hmư̆, laih anŭn tơlơi arăng hmư̆ tơbiă rai mơ̆ng boh pơhiăp Yang Krist arăng hmâo pơtô.
But I say, Have they not heard? Yea, surely, Their voice has gone out into all the earth, and their words to the extremities of the habitable world. @ Samơ̆ kâo tơña, djơ̆ mơ̆ gơñu aka ƀu hmư̆ djơ̆ ôh? Sĭt biă mă gơñu hmâo hmư̆ laih! Yua kơ:
“Jua hiăp ƀing nao ră ruai Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam arăng hmâo hmư̆ laih tar ƀar lŏn tơnah,
Laih anŭn boh pơhiăp gơñu hmâo nao truh pơ rơnuč lŏn tơnah.”
But I say, Has not Israel known? First, Moses says, *I* will provoke you to jealousy through [them that are] not a nation: through a nation without understanding I will anger you. @ Kâo tơña dơ̆ng, ƀing Israel aka ƀu thâo hluh ôh hă? Sĭt biă mă, blŭng hlâo Môis hmâo laĭ:
“Kâo či ngă brơi ƀing gih hmâo tơlơi gar moañ kơ ƀing djuai mơnuih ƀu jing sa djuai mơnuih ôh;
Kâo či ngă brơi ƀing gih hil rơañ yua kơ sa djuai mơnuih mlŭk mơgu.”
But Esaias is very bold, and says, I have been found by those not seeking me; I have become manifest to those not inquiring after me. @ Laih anŭn Êsai pơhiăp hăng tơlơi khĭn tui anai:
“Ƀing mơnuih ƀu sem hơduah kâo ôh, gơñu hmâo ƀuh laih Kâo.
Kâo hmâo pơrơđah laih Kâo pô kơ ƀing mơnuih ƀu rơkâo tơña Kâo ôh.”
But unto Israel he says, All the day long I have stretched out my hands unto a people disobeying and opposing. @ Samơ̆ djơ̆ kơ ƀing Israel Ñu laĭ: “Abih hrơi Kâo păng tơngan anăp nao kơ sa djuai mơnuih khăng akŏ hăng ƀu tui gưt anai.”
I say then, Has God cast away his people? Far be the thought. For *I* also am an Israelite, of [the] seed of Abraham, of [the] tribe of Benjamin. @ Tui anŭn kâo tơña, Ơi Adai hmâo hrah lui ƀing ană plei Ñu mơ̆? Sĭt ƀu djơ̆ tui anŭn ôh! Kâo pô mơ̆n jing sa čô mơnuih Israel, ană tơčo Abraham, sa čô mơ̆ng djuai Benjamin. 
God has not cast away his people whom he foreknew. Know ye not what the scripture says in [the history of] Elias, how he pleads with God against Israel? @ Ơi Adai ƀu hrah lui hĭ ôh ană plei Ñu jing ƀing Ñu thâo krăn laih mơ̆ng hlâo. Ƀing gih ƀu thâo ôh hă hơgĕt Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih djơ̆ kơ Êli, hyư̆m ñu phong ană Israel ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai? 
Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have dug down thine altars; and *I* have been left alone, and they seek my life. @ “Ơ Khua Yang, gơñu hmâo pơdjai laih ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo Ih, gơñu pơglưh hĭ laih abih bang kơƀang ngă yang kơ Ih. Dŏ kơnơ̆ng hơjăn kâo đôč, laih anŭn gơñu ăt hơduah kiăng pơdjai kâo mơ̆n.” 
But what says the divine answer to him? I have left to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed knee to Baal. @ Samơ̆ hyư̆m Ơi Adai laĭ glaĭ kơ ñu? “Kâo hmâo răk pioh laih kơ Kâo pô tơjuh rơbâo đah rơkơi aka ƀu tŏ tơŭt ƀơi anăp yang Baal ôh.” 
Thus, then, in the present time also there has been a remnant according to election of grace. @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n amăng rơnŭk anai, hmâo sa črăn dŏ tơsot glaĭ dưi ruah mă laih hăng tơlơi pap. 
But if by grace, no longer of works: since [otherwise] grace is no more grace. @ Samơ̆ Ñu ruah mă gơñu mơ̆ng tơlơi pap, ƀu djơ̆ mơ̆ng bruă gơñu ngă ôh. Tơdah ƀu djơ̆ tui anŭn, tơlơi pap anŭn ƀu jing tơlơi pap dơ̆ng ôh.
What [is it] then? What Israel seeks for, that he has not obtained; but the election has obtained, and the rest have been blinded, @ Hyư̆m tui anŭn? Tơlơi ƀing ană Israel tui hơduah, gơñu ƀu dưi hmâo ôh. Samơ̆ ƀing Ơi Adai ruah hmâo laih tơlơi anŭn, samơ̆ ƀing dŏ glaĭ Ơi Adai pơkhăng hĭ pran jua gơñu, 
according as it is written, God has given to them a spirit of slumber, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear, unto this day. @ Tui hăng hră Ơi Adai pơhiăp hmâo čih:
“Ơi Adai hmâo brơi kơ gơñu bơngăt jua mơmŏt,
Mơta ƀu thâo ƀuh, laih anŭn tơngia tơngil hlŏng truh pơ hrơi anai.”
And David says, Let their table be for a snare, and for a gin, and for a fall-trap, and for a recompense to them: @ Laih anŭn Đawit laĭ:
“Brơi kơƀang gơñu ƀơ̆ng huă jing hĭ čơđong laih anŭn jal klŭp,

Laih anŭn brơi rŏng gơñu gô nanao.”
I say then, Have they stumbled in order that they might fall? Far be the thought: but by their fall [there is] salvation to the nations to provoke them to jealousy. @ Tui anŭn kâo tơña, djơ̆ mơ̆ ƀing ană Israel hmâo tơhnač laih tơl rơbuh hăng răm rai hĭ?

But if their fall [be the] world's wealth, and their loss [the] wealth of [the] nations, how much rather their fulness? @ Tui anŭn tơdah tơlơi gơñu ngă soh anŭn pơjing pơdrŏng brơi kơ lŏn tơnah, laih anŭn tơdah tơlơi gơñu rơbuh pơjing tơlơi pơdrŏng kơ ƀing djuai tuai, ƀai jai yơh tơlơi pơdrŏng sah hloh dơ̆ng či truh tơdah abih bang ƀing gơñu wơ̆t glaĭ kơ Ơi Adai dơ̆ng!
For I speak to you, the nations, inasmuch as *I* am apostle of nations, I glorify my ministry; @ Ră anai kâo laĭ kơ ƀing gih ơ ƀing djuai tuai, tơdang kâo ăt dŏ jing khua ding kơna kơ ƀing djuai tuai, kâo či pơpŭ kơdrưh kơ bruă kâo,

For if their casting away [be the] world's reconciliation, what [their] reception but life from among [the] dead? @ Yua kơ tơdah tơlơi Ơi Adai hrah lui gơñu jing hĭ tơlơi pơgop rơnom kơ abih lŏn tơnah, hơgĕt tơlơi či truh yua mơ̆ng tơlơi jum glaĭ gơñu? Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă jing kar hăng brơi tơlơi hơdip kơ ƀing djai laih?
Now if the first-fruit [be] holy, the lump also; and if the root [be] holy, the branches also. @ Tơdah boh blŭng hlâo pơyơr jing rơgoh hiam, tui anŭn abih bang jing rơgoh hiam kar kaĭ mơ̆n. Laih anŭn tơdah akha kơyâo pơyơr jing rơgoh hiam, abih bang than jing rơgoh hiam kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
Now if some of the branches have been broken out, and *thou*, being a wild olive tree, hast been grafted in amongst them, and hast become a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree, @ Samơ̆ tơdah hmâo đơđa than arăng trơĭ hĭ laih, laih anŭn ih jing sa ƀĕ than ôliwơ glai, arăng pơtĕp ƀlir ƀơi anih arăng trơĭ hĭ gơ̆ laih, kiăng kơ ih dưi hmâo kơtăk hơdip mơ̆ng akha boh ôliwơ,

Thou wilt say then, The branches have been broken out in order that *I* might be grafted in. @ Ih či laĭ: “Khul than arăng hmâo trơĭ hĭ, kiăng kơ dưi pơtĕp ƀlir kâo ƀơi anih anŭn.” 
Right: they have been broken out through unbelief, and *thou* standest through faith. Be not high-minded, but fear: @ Tơlơi anŭn djơ̆ sĭt. Arăng hmâo trơĭ hĭ gơñu yua kơ tơlơi gơñu ƀu đaŏ. Samơ̆ ih kơnơ̆ng dưi dŏ kơjăp yua kơ tơlơi ih đaŏ. Tui anŭn anăm pơgao ôh, samơ̆ brơi hwĭ bĕ.

Behold then [the] goodness and severity of God: upon them who have fallen, severity; upon thee goodness of God, if thou shalt abide in goodness, since [otherwise] *thou* also wilt be cut away. @ Brơi ih thâo hluh bĕ tơlơi hiam klă hăng tơlơi khăng khĭp Ơi Adai: khăng khĭp hăng ƀing hmâo rơbuh laih, samơ̆ Ơi Adai ngă hiam klă kơ ih, tŭ kơ ih ăt dŏ nanao amăng tơlơi hiam klă Ñu. Tơdah ih ƀu dŏ amăng tơlơi hiam klă Ñu ôh, Ñu či trơĭ hĭ ih kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
And *they* too, if they abide not in unbelief, shall be grafted in; for God is able again to graft them in. @ Wơ̆t kơ ƀing Yuđa kar kaĭ mơ̆n, tơdah gơñu lui hĭ tơlơi ƀu đaŏ, Ơi Adai či pơklep glaĭ gơñu dơ̆ng, yua kơ Ơi Adai hmâo tơlơi dưi pơklep glaĭ gơñu. 
For if *thou* hast been cut out of the olive tree wild by nature, and, contrary to nature, hast been grafted into the good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature be grafted into their own olive tree? @ Yua kơ tơdah arăng hmâo trơĭ mă ih mơ̆ng phŭn ôliwơ hơđăp jing phŭn ôliwơ glai, ăt dưi mơ̆n pơklep ih hăng phŭn ôliwơ arăng pla hăng wai rơnăk, phara hăng tơlơi juăt yang đar, ƀai jai yơh amuñ hloh dơ̆ng arăng či pơklep glaĭ than sĭt amăng phŭn ôliwơ hơđăp gơñu pô.
For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that ye may not be wise in your own conceits, that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the nations be come in; @ Ơ adơi ayŏng, kâo kiăng kơ ƀing gih thâo hluh tơlơi yom hơgơ̆m anai, hwĭ kơ ƀing gih pơgao pơmĭn dah ƀing gih jing ƀing mơnuih kơhnâo, anŭn jing: sa črăn amăng ƀing Israel ăt dŏ khăng pran jua, tơl mrô ƀing djuai tuai mŭt tum laih tui hăng Ơi Adai hmâo pơkơčah.

If therefore thine enemy should hunger, feed him; if he should thirst, give him drink; for, so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head. @ Samơ̆: “tơdah pô ayăt ih rơpa brơi bĕ ñu ƀơ̆ng; tơdah ñu mơhao, brơi bĕ ñu mơñum, yua kơ ngă tui anŭn ƀu phara ôh ih pioh anga apui ƀơi akŏ ñu.”

Let every soul be subject to the authorities that are above [him]. For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God. @ Brơi abih bang mơnuih khŏm gưt kơ tơlơi dưi kơnuk kơna.

So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who [thus] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves. @ Yua kơ anŭn, hlơi pô pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ hăng tơlơi dưi kơnuk kơna, ñu anŭn pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ tơlơi Ơi Adai hmâo pơdưm brơi.

For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil [one]. Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise [what is] good, and thou shalt have praise from it; @ Yua kơ ƀing khua wai lăng ƀu ngă pơhwĭ kơ ƀing ngă hiam ôh, samơ̆ kơ ƀing ngă sat.

for it is God's minister to thee for good. But if thou practisest evil, fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God's minister, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil. @ Yua kơ ƀing khua moa jing ding kơna kơ Ơi Adai kiăng ngă tơlơi hiam kơ ih.

So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God. @ Tui anŭn rĭm čô ƀing ta či pơhaih bruă ta pô ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai.
Let us no longer therefore judge one another; but judge ye this rather, not to put a stumbling-block or a fall-trap before his brother. @ Tui anŭn, anăm ƀing ta phat kơđi tơdruă ƀing ta ôh, samơ̆ hiam hloh khư̆p ư anăm ngă tơhnač ƀôdah pơgŭn jơlan kơ adơi ayŏng ƀing ta ôh.

For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe. @ Yua kơ amăng tơlơi kơhnâo Ơi Adai, lŏn tơnah ƀu dưi kơnang hăng tơlơi kơhnâo ñu pô ôh kiăng kơ thâo krăn Ơi Adai, samơ̆ Ơi Adai mơak kiăng yua “tơlơi pơtô mlŭk” kơ gơmơi pơtô kiăng pơklaih ƀing mơnuih đaŏ.

but according as it is written, Things which eye has not seen, and ear not heard, and which have not come into man's heart, which God has prepared for them that love him, @ Samơ̆, tui hăng hră Ơi Adai hmâo čih laih:
“Hơgĕt tơlơi mơta aka ƀuh, tơngia aka hmư̆,

Samơ̆ Ơi Adai hmâo pơkra pioh brơi laih kơ ƀing khăp kơ Ñu,”
but God has revealed to us by [his] Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. @ Samơ̆ Ơi Adai hmâo pơrơđah laih kơ ƀing ta khul tơlơi anŭn mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam. Yua kơ Yang Bơngăt Hiam thâo rơđah abih bang tơlơi, wơ̆t kơ khul tơlơi dlam hơgơ̆m Ơi Adai. 
For who of men hath known the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? thus also the things of God knows no one except the Spirit of God. @ Yua kơ hlơi dưi thâo tơlơi pơmĭn sa čô mơnuih, kơnơ̆ng bơngăt jua ñu pô yơh. Kar kaĭ mơ̆n ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi thâo tơlơi pơmĭn Ơi Adai ôh, kơnơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ơi Adai đôč. 
But *we* have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which [is] of God, that we may know the things which have been freely given to us of God: @ Ƀing ta ƀu mă tŭ bơngăt lŏn tơnah ôh, samơ̆ ƀing ta mă tŭ laih Yang Bơngăt Hiam mơ̆ng Ơi Adai, kiăng kơ ƀing ta dưi hluh tơlơi pha brơi Ơi Adai hmâo pha brơi laih kơ ƀing ta. 
which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual [things] by spiritual [means]. @ Laih anŭn gơmơi pơhiăp tơlơi anŭn, ƀu djơ̆ hăng boh pơhiăp mơ̆ng tơlơi kơhnâo ană mơnuih pơtô ôh, samơ̆ mơ̆ng tơlơi Yang Bơngăt Hiam pơtô, hăng boh pơhiăp mơyang pơblang khul tơlơi sĭt gah mơyang. 
But [the] natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him; and he cannot know [them] because they are spiritually discerned; @ Mơnuih ƀu hmâo Yang Bơngăt Hiam ƀu dưi mă tŭ ôh khul tơlơi Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ơi Adai pha brơi, yua kơ mơnuih anŭn lăng tơlơi anŭn jing tơlơi mlŭk, laih anŭn ñu ƀu dưi hluh tơlơi anŭn ôh, yua kơ hăng tơlơi pơmĭn mơyang yơh arăng dưi kơsem tơlơi anŭn. 
but the spiritual discerns all things, and *he* is discerned of no one. @ Mơnuih hmâo Yang Bơngăt Hiam dưi kơsem lăng abih bang tơlơi, samơ̆ ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi kơsem lăng ñu ôh.
For who has known the mind of [the] Lord, who shall instruct him? But *we* have the mind of Christ. @ “Yua kơ hlơi dưi thâo tơlơi pơmĭn Khua Yang,
Kiăng kơ dưi pơhrăm brơi Ñu?”
Samơ̆ ƀing ta hmâo tơlơi pơmĭn Yang Krist.
And *I*, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ. @ Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, kâo ƀu dưi pơhiăp hăng ƀing gih kar hăng pơhiăp hăng ƀing mơnuih gah bơngăt ôh, samơ̆ kar hăng mơnuih gah asar đeh, kar hăng ƀing ană nge amăng Krist.

Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each. @ Tui anŭn hlơi Apôlôs jing? Hlơi Pôl jing?

*I* have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase. @ Kâo hmâo pla laih, Apôlôs hmâo tuh ia laih, samơ̆ Ơi Adai brơi čăt đĭ kơ prŏng. 
So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase. @ Tui anŭn pô pla hăng pô tuh ia ƀu jing yom ôh, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng Ơi Adai Pô ngă brơi čăt đĭ kơ prŏng yơh jing yom. 
But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. @ Pô pla hăng pô tuh ia jing kar kaĭ đôč, rĭm čô či mă tŭ pri apah tui hăng bruă ñu hmâo ngă. 
For we are God's fellow-workmen; ye are God's husbandry, God's building. @ Yua kơ ƀing gơmơi jing gơyut mă bruă hrŏm hơbĭt kơ Ơi Adai, ƀing gih jing hmua kơ Ơi Adai, ƀing gih ăt jing sang kơ Ơi Adai mơ̆n.
According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it. @ Tui hăng tơlơi pap Ơi Adai hmâo brơi laih kơ kâo, kâo hmâo dưm atur kar hăng sa čô mơnuih kơhnăk bruă, laih anŭn pô pơkŏn dŏ pơdơ̆ng sang ƀơi atur anŭn. Brơi rĭm čô khŏm răng kơ tơlơi ñu pơdơ̆ng ƀơi atur anŭn. 
For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ. @ Yua kơ, ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi pơdơ̆ng sa atur pơkŏn dơ̆ng tah gah rơngiao kơ atur hmâo pơdơ̆ng laih, anŭn jing Khua Yang Yêsu Krist. 
Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw, @ Tơdah arăng pơdơ̆ng ƀơi atur anŭn hăng mah, hăng prăk, hăng boh pơtâo yom, hăng kơyâo, hăng rơ̆k kro, hăng adrăng pơdai, 
the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is. @ bruă rĭm čô či pơrơđah, ƀơi hrơi Khua Yang či pơrơđah brơi hyư̆m bruă anŭn jing, laih anŭn apui či pơrơđah brơi bruă anŭn, apui či lông lăng nua yom kơ bruă rĭm čô hmâo ngă laih. 
If the work of any one which he has built upon [the foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward. @ Tơdah bruă hlơi pô hmâo pơdơ̆ng laih ƀơi atur anŭn ăt dŏ, pô anŭn či mă tŭ pri apah. 
If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but *he* shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire. @ Tơdah bruă hlơi pô apui ƀơ̆ng hĭ, pô anŭn či rơngiă hĭ pri apah; bơ ñu pô či klaih mơ̆n, samơ̆ kar hăng tơbiă mơ̆ng apui đôč.
Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you? @  Ƀing gih ƀu thâo ôh hă ƀing gih jing sang kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai, laih anŭn Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ơi Adai dŏ amăng ƀing gih? 
If any one corrupt the temple of God, *him* shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are *ye*. @ Tơdah hlơi pô pơrai sang kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai, Ơi Adai či pơrai hĭ ñu. Yua kơ sang kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai jing rơgoh hiam, laih anŭn ƀing gih jing sang kơkuh pơpŭ anŭn.
Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise. @ Anăm hlơi ƀlor mă ñu pô ôh. Tơdah sa čô amăng ƀing gih pơmĭn ñu jing kơhnâo tui hăng rơnŭk anai, brơi ñu jing hĭ sa čô mlŭk, kiăng kơ ñu dưi jing kơhnâo. 
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness. @ Yua kơ Ơi Adai yap tơlơi kơhnâo lŏn tơnah anai jing tơlơi mlŭk. Kar hăng hră Ơi Adai hmâo čih laih:
“Ơi Adai mă ƀing mơnuih kơhnâo
Amăng tơlơi mơneč gơñu pô,”
And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain. @  Laih anŭn,
“Khua Yang thâo tơlơi pơmĭn ƀing kơhnâo
Leng kơ jing đôč đač.”
So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours. @ Tui anŭn, anăm hlơi pơ-ư pơang kơ bruă ană mơnuih ngă ôh. Yua kơ abih bang tơlơi leng kơ lơ̆m kơ ƀing gih soh sel, 
Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours; @ thâo dah Pôl, Apôlôs, Sêphas, lŏn tơnah, tơlơi hơdip, tơlơi djai, rơnŭk anai, ƀôdah rơnŭk tơdơi, abih bang leng kơ lơ̆m kơ ƀing gih soh sel. 
and *ye* [are] Christ's, and Christ [is] God's. @ Laih anŭn ƀing gih lơ̆m kơ Krist; laih anŭn Krist lơ̆m kơ Ơi Adai.
Let a man so account of us as servants of Christ, and stewards of [the] mysteries of God. @ Tui anŭn, abih bang mơnuih lăng bĕ ƀing gơmơi kar hăng ƀing ding kơna Krist, laih anŭn ƀing ngă bruă wai lăng khul tơlơi yom hơgơ̆m Ơi Adai. 
Here, further, it is sought in stewards, that a man be found faithful. @ Tơlơi arăng kiăng khŏm kơ hmâo ƀơi mơnuih ngă bruă wai lăng anŭn jing khŏm tŏng ten. 
But for me it is the very smallest matter that I be examined of you or of man's day. Nor do I even examine myself. @ Bơ kâo, kâo ƀu yap yom ôh kơ tơlơi ƀing gih ƀôdah ƀing mơnuih pơkŏn phat kơđi kâo. Kâo pô ăt kŏn phat kơđi kâo pô lơi. 
For I am conscious of nothing in myself; but I am not justified by this: but he that examines me is the Lord. @ Kâo ƀu ƀuh ôh sa mơta tơlơi soh glaĭ amăng kâo, samơ̆ ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi anŭn kâo hmâo laih tơlơi yap tơpă hơnơ̆ng. Khua Yang jing Pô phat kơđi kâo. 
So that do not judge anything before [the] time, until the Lord shall come, who shall also both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and shall make manifest the counsels of hearts; and then shall each have [his] praise from God. @ Tui anŭn, anăm phat kơđi arăng ôh hlâo kơ hrơi pơkơčah, hlâo kơ Khua Yang truh.

Now these things, brethren, I have transferred, in their application, to myself and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye may learn in us the [lesson of] not [letting your thoughts go] above what is written, that ye may not be puffed up one for [such a] one against another. @ Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, yua kơ tơlơi tŭ yua kơ ƀing gih, kâo hmâo hrăm mă laih khul tơlơi anai kơ kâo pô laih anŭn kơ Apôlôs, kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi hrăm mơ̆ng gơmơi tơlơi kiăng laĭ kơ boh pơhiăp: “Anăm rơgao hĭ tơlơi hmâo čih laih,” kiăng kơ ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô amăng ƀing gih ngă tơlơi pơgao hluai tui pô anai pơkơdơ̆ng glaĭ hăng pô pơkŏn. 
For who makes thee to differ? and what hast thou which thou hast not received? but if also thou hast received, why boastest thou as not receiving? @ Hlơi ngă brơi kơ ih yom hloh kơ pô pơkŏn? Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă Ơi Adai hmâo brơi laih ih abih mơnơ̆ng ih hmâo? Tơdah ih mă tŭ laih tơlơi anŭn, hyư̆m ih pơ-ư pơang kơ ih pô kar hăng ih aka mă tŭ ôh lĕ?
Already ye are filled; already ye have been enriched; ye have reigned without us; and I would that ye reigned, that *we* also might reign with you. @ Ƀing gih hmâo djŏp tum laih!

For I think that God has set us the apostles for the last, as appointed to death.

There is a difference between the wife and the virgin.

What is the reward then that I have? That in announcing the glad tidings I make the glad tidings costless [to others], so as not to have made use, as belonging to me, of my right in [announcing] the glad tidings. @ Tui anŭn hơgĕt pri kơ kâo lĕ?

No temptation has taken you but such as is according to man's nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able [to bear], but will with the temptation make the issue also, so that [ye] should be able to bear [it]. @ Ƀu hmâo ôh sa mơta tơlơi lông lăng truh kơ ƀing gih phara hloh kơ tơlơi truh kơ ƀing pơkŏn.

But [in] prescribing [to you on] this [which I now enter on], I do not praise, [namely,] that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse. @ Amăng tơlơi pơtô gah yŭ anai, kâo ƀu bơni kơ ƀing gih ôh, yua kơ ƀing gih bơjơnum ƀu ba glaĭ tơlơi hiam hloh ôh, samơ̆ jing sat hloh dơ̆ng.

For each one in eating takes his *own* supper before [others], and one is hungry and another drinks to excess. @ Yua kơ tơdang ƀơ̆ng, rĭm čô hăt ƀơ̆ng mơnơ̆ng ñu pô, tơl kơ pô anai rơpa laih anŭn pô pơkŏn măt tơpai. 
Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this [point] I do not praise. @ Hyư̆m ngă! Ƀing gih ƀu hmâo ôh hă sang pioh kơ ƀơ̆ng huă laih anŭn mơñum?

For *I* received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread, @ Yua kơ kâo hmâo mă tŭ laih mơ̆ng Khua Yang tơlơi kâo hmâo pơtô laih kơ ƀing gih: Amăng mlam arăng pơblư̆ Khua Yang Yêsu, Ñu mă ƀañ tơpŭng,

In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink [it], in remembrance of me. @ Kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n, giơ̆ng kơ ƀơ̆ng huă mlam, Ñu mă kơčok laih anŭn laĭ: “Kơčok anai jing Kơnol Pơgop Phrâo amăng drah Kâo.

For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come. @ Tui anŭn, rĭm wơ̆t ƀing gih ƀơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng anai, laih anŭn mơñum kơčok anai, brơi kơ ƀing gih ră ruai tơlơi Khua Yang djai tơl hrơi Ñu rai dơ̆ng.
So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh, hlơi pô ƀơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng ƀôdah mơñum kơčok Khua Yang hăng tơlơi ƀu năng lăp ôh, ñu anŭn či soh hăng drơi jan laih anŭn hăng drah Khua Yang. 
But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. @ Tui anŭn, brơi kơ rĭm čô khŏm kơsem lăng ñu pô hlâo, hnŭn yơh ñu dưi ƀơ̆ng ƀañ tơpŭng laih anŭn mơñum kơčok anŭn.

But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged. @ Tơdah ƀing ta thâo kơsem lăng ƀing ta pô hlâo, ƀing ta ƀu či tŭ tơlơi phat kơđi ôh. 
But being judged, we are disciplined of [the] Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world. @ Samơ̆ tơ Khua Yang phat kơđi ƀing ta, Ñu pơkra ƀing ta, kiăng kơ ƀing ta ƀu či tŭ ôh tơlơi klă kơđi hrŏm hơbĭt hăng lŏn tơnah.
So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another. @ Tui anŭn, Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, tơ ƀing gih bơjơnum glaĭ kơ tơlơi ƀơ̆ng pơgop rơgoh hiam, dŏ tơguan bĕ tơdruă ƀing gih. 
If any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together for judgment. But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order. @ Tơdah hmâo hlơi rơpa, brơi ñu ƀơ̆ng huă bĕ pơ sang ñu pô, kiăng kơ tơlơi ƀing gih bơjơnum ƀu ba glaĭ tơlơi klă kơđi kơ ƀing gih ôh.

I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in [the power of the] Spirit of God, says, Curse [on] Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in [the power of the] Holy Spirit. @ Yua kơ anŭn, kâo kiăng ƀing gih thâo hluh tơlơi anai, ƀu hmâo ôh hlơi hmâo Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ơi Adai dui ba ñu laih anŭn dưi laĭ: “Hơtơ̆m pah kơ Yêsu!” Laih anŭn ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô dưi pơhaih: “Yêsu jing Khua Yang,” tơdah ƀu hmâo Yang Bơngăt Hiam atăt gai ñu.
But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit; @  Hmâo lu mơta tơlơi pha brơi phara phara, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng hmâo hasa Yang Bơngăt Hiam đôč. 
and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord; @ Hmâo lu mơta bruă phara phara, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng hmâo hasa Khua Yang; 
and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all. @ Hmâo lu mơta bruă ngă phara phara, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng hmâo hasa Ơi Adai brơi tơlơi dưi ngă abih bang bruă amăng rĭm čô mơnuih. 
But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit. @ Tơlơi Yang Bơngăt Hiam bơrơđah brơi hmâo pha brơi laih kơ rĭm čô mơnuih, yua kơ tơlơi tŭ yua brơi kơ abih bang. 
For to one, by the Spirit, is given [the] word of wisdom; and to another [the] word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; @ Kơ pô anai Yang Bơngăt Hiam pha brơi tơlơi dưi thâo pơhiăp hăng tơlơi kơhnâo; kơ pô pơkŏn ăt Yang Bơngăt Hiam anŭn mơ̆n pha brơi tơlơi dưi pơhiăp hăng tơlơi thâo thaĭ. 
and to a different one faith, in [the power of] the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in [the power of] the same Spirit; @ Ăt hasa Yang Bơngăt Hiam anŭn mơ̆n pha brơi kơ pô anai tơlơi đaŏ, ăt hasa Yang Bơngăt Hiam anŭn mơ̆n pha brơi kơ pô pơkŏn tơlơi dưi pơsuaih tơlơi duăm ruă. 
and to another operations of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues. @ Yang Bơngăt hiam brơi kơ pô anai tơlơi dưi ngă tơlơi mơsêh mơyang, brơi kơ pô pơkŏn tơlơi dưi laĭ lui hlâo, kơ pô pơkŏn dơ̆ng tơlơi dưi thâo bơkơnăl yang phara phara.

But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases. @ Abih bang tơlơi pha brơi anŭn tơbiă mơ̆ng hasa Yang Bơngăt Hiam đôč, Pô pha brơi kơ rĭm čô tui hăng Ñu kiăng.
For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also [is] the Christ. @  Yua kơ kar hăng sa drơi jan samơ̆ hmâo lu črăn; wơ̆t dah hmâo lu črăn samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng jing sa drơi jan đôč, Yang Krist ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n. 
For also in [the power of] one Spirit *we* have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit. @ Yua kơ mơ̆ng hasa Yang Bơngăt Hiam abih bang ƀing ta tŭ laih ƀatem pơgop amăng sa drơi jan — ƀing Yuđa ƀôdah ƀing Grek, ƀing hlŭn ƀôdah ƀing rơngai — laih anŭn Ơi Adai brơi abih bang ƀing ta mơñum hrŏm hơbĭt sa Yang Bơngăt Hiam anŭn.
For also the body is not one member but many. @ Yua kơ drơi jan ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng jing rai mơ̆ng sa črăn đôč ôh, samơ̆ mơ̆ng lu črăn. 
If the foot say, Because I am not a hand I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body? @ Tơdah tơkai laĭ: “Yua kơ kâo ƀu jing sa ƀĕ tơngan, kâo ƀu lơ̆m kơ drơi jan ôh,” tơlơi anŭn ƀu dưi pơklah ñu mơ̆ng drơi jan ôh. 
And if the ear say, Because I am not an eye I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body? @ Laih anŭn tơdah tơngia laĭ: “Yua kơ kâo ƀu jing mơta ôh, kâo ƀu dŏ amăng drơi jan ôh,” tơlơi anŭn ƀu dưi pơklah ñu mơ̆ng drơi jan ôh. 
If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if all hearing, where the smelling? @ Tơdah abih drơi jan jing mơta soh sel, hyư̆m dưi thâo hmư̆ lĕ? Tơdah abih drơi jan leng kơ jing tơngia soh sel, hyư̆m dưi thâo ƀâu lĕ? 
But now God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased [him]. @ Kar hăng ñu hmâo jing laih, Ơi Adai hmâo pơdăp laih rĭm črăn amăng drơi jan tui hăng tơlơi Ñu kiăng yơh. 
But if all were one member, where the body? @ Tơdah abih bang kơnơ̆ng jing sa črăn đôč, hyư̆m dưi jing drơi jan lĕ? 
But now the members [are] many, and the body one. @ Tui anŭn, hmâo lu črăn samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng hmâo sa drơi jan đôč.
The eye cannot say to the hand, I have not need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have not need of you. @ Mơta ƀu dưi laĭ ôh kơ tơngan: “Kâo ƀu kiăng kơ ih ôh!” Akŏ kŏn dưi laĭ lơi kơ tơkai: “Kâo ƀu kiăng kơ ih ôh!” 
But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary; @ Kơđai glaĭ, khul črăn pă amăng drơi jan lăng jing kar hăng tơdu hloh, samơ̆ ñu ăt jing yom brơi kơ drơi jan mơ̆n. 
and those [parts] of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness; @ Khul črăn pă amăng drơi jan ƀing ta pơmĭn ƀu pơpŭ đơi ôh, jing črăn ƀing ta pơpŭ lu hloh dơ̆ng, laih anŭn črăn pă amăng drơi ƀing ta pơmĭn ƀu hiam rŏ ôh, ƀing ta pơhrôp hiam rŏ hloh dơ̆ng. 
but our comely [parts] have not need. But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to [the part] that lacked; @ Bơ kơ črăn pă hiam rŏ laih, ƀing ta ƀu kiăng pơhrôp dơ̆ng ôh. Samơ̆ Ơi Adai hmâo pơdăp dưm laih drơi jan kar hăng anŭn, kiăng kơ črăn pă ƀu pơpŭ đơi ôh dưi hmâo tơlơi pơpŭ lu hloh,

Now *ye* are Christ's body, and members in particular. @ Ƀing gih jing drơi jan Krist, laih anŭn rĭm čô jing sa črăn amăng drơi jan Ñu. 
And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues. @ Ơi Adai hmâo dăp dưm laih amăng Phung Sang Ơi Adai, tal sa jing ƀing khua ding kơna, tal dua jing ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo, tal klâo jing ƀing nai pơtô, laih anŭn ƀing ngă tơlơi mơsêh mơyang, ƀing hmâo tơlơi dưi pơsuaih tơlơi duăm ruă, ƀing thâo djru, ƀing thâo wai lăng, laih anŭn ƀing dưi pơhiăp tơlơi tuai phara phara.

Even lifeless things giving a sound, whether pipe or harp, if they give not distinction to the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? @ Wơ̆t kơ khul kơdrăp ayŭ hri ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơdip, kar hăng đing klơt ƀôdah brŏ, tơdah asăp gơñu mơñi ƀu hmâo tơlơi phara klă rơđah ôh, hyư̆m arăng dưi thâo krăn ayŭ đing klơt ƀôdah ayŭ brŏ? 
For also, if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for war? @ Laih anŭn tơdah asăp tơki ƀu klă rơđah ôh, hlơi pô či prăp rơmet kơ tơlơi pơblah? 
Thus also *ye* with the tongue, unless ye give a distinct speech, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking to the air. @ Ƀing gih ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n, tơdah ƀing gih pơhiăp tơlơi tuai arăng ƀu thâo hluh ôh, hyư̆m arăng dưi thâo hluh hơgĕt tơlơi ƀing gih laĭ? Yua kơ ƀing gih pơhiăp amăng angĭn yơh. 
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of undistinguishable sound. @ Sĭt biă mă hmâo lu mơta tơlơi pơhiăp phara phara amăng lŏn tơnah anai, laih anŭn rĭm mơta tơlơi pơhiăp leng kơ hmâo tơlơi kiăng pơblang soh sel. 
If therefore I do not know the power of the sound, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks a barbarian for me. @ Samơ̆ tơdah kâo ƀu thâo hluh tơlơi pơhiăp anŭn ôh, kâo či jing sa čô mơnuih tuai hăng pô pơhiăp anŭn, laih anŭn pô pơhiăp či jing sa čô tuai hăng kâo. 
Thus *ye* also, since ye are desirous of spirits, seek that ye may abound for the edification of the assembly. @ Ƀing gih ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n, yua kơ ƀing gih hur har kiăng hmâo tơlơi pha brơi mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam, tui hơduah bĕ kiăng kơ hmâo rơbeh blai tơlơi pha brơi mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam kiăng kơ pơdơ̆ng pơđĭ Phung Sang Ơi Adai rai kơ prŏng.
Wherefore let him that speaks with a tongue pray that he may interpret. @ Yua kơ anŭn, hlơi pô pơhiăp tơlơi tuai, brơi ñu iâu laĭ kiăng hmâo tơlơi dưi pơblang boh pơhiăp anŭn. 
For if I pray with a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. @ Yua kơ tơdah kâo iâu laĭ hăng tơlơi tuai, bơngăt kâo dŏ iâu laĭ, samơ̆ tơlơi pơmĭn kâo ƀu mă tŭ tơlơi hơgĕt ôh. 
What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, but I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing also with the understanding. @ Tui anŭn hơgĕt kâo khŏm ngă? Kâo či iâu laĭ hăng bơngăt jua, samơ̆ kâo ăt či iâu laĭ hăng tơlơi pơmĭn mơ̆n. Kâo či adoh hăng bơngăt, samơ̆ kâo ăt či adoh hăng tơlơi pơmĭn kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
Since otherwise, if thou blessest with [the] spirit, how shall he who fills the place of the simple [Christian] say Amen, at thy giving of thanks, since he does not know what thou sayest? @ Samơ̆ tơdah ih bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai kơnơ̆ng hăng bơngăt đôč, hyư̆m ƀing mơnuih ƀu hmâo tơlơi pha brơi amăng ƀing bơjơnum anŭn dưi laĭ “Amen” kơ tơlơi ih iâu laĭ bơni hơơč; yua kơ ñu ƀu thâo hluh ôh tơlơi ih pơhiăp? 
For *thou* indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified. @ Wơ̆t dah tơlơi ih iâu laĭ bơni hơơč anŭn hiam biă mă, samơ̆ ƀu pơdơ̆ng pơđĭ pô pơkŏn ôh.
I thank God I speak in a tongue more than all of you: @ Kâo bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai yua kơ kâo dưi pơhiăp tơlơi tuai lu hloh kơ abih bang ƀing gih; 
but in [the] assembly I desire to speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also, [rather] than ten thousand words in a tongue. @ samơ̆ amăng Phung Sang Ơi Adai, hiam hloh kâo pơhiăp rơma boh hăng tơlơi pơmĭn kâo kiăng pơhrăm ƀing pơkŏn, hloh kơ pơhiăp pluh rơbâo boh amăng tơlơi tuai.
Brethren, be not children in [your] minds, but in malice be babes; but in [your] minds be grown [men]. @ Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, kơ tơlơi thâo hluh, anăm jing kar hăng čơđai ôh, samơ̆ kơ tơlơi sat, jing bĕ kar hăng čơđai. Kơ tơlơi thâo hluh jing bĕ kar hăng mơnuih truh tha. 
It is written in the law, By people of other tongues, and by strange lips, will I speak to this people; and neither thus will they hear me, saith the Lord. @ Amăng tơlơi juăt hmâo čih laih:
“Khua Yang laĭ: Hăng ƀing mơnuih pơhiăp tơlơi tuai laih anŭn hăng amăng bah ƀing djuai tuai kâo či pơhiăp hăng ƀing ană plei anai,
Samơ̆ wơ̆t dah tui anŭn, ƀing gơñu ƀu či hmư̆ Kâo ôh.”
So that tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe, but to unbelievers; but prophecy, not to unbelievers, but to those who believe. @ Tui anŭn, khul boh pơhiăp tơlơi tuai ƀu djơ̆ jing gru kơnăl kơ ƀing mơnuih đaŏ ôh, samơ̆ kơ ƀing mơnuih ƀu đaŏ; tơdang anŭn tơlơi laĭ lui hlâo ƀu djơ̆ jing gru kơnăl kơ ƀing ƀu đaŏ ôh, samơ̆ kơ ƀing mơnuih đaŏ.
If therefore the whole assembly come together in one place, and all speak with tongues, and simple [persons] enter in, or unbelievers, will not they say ye are mad? @ Tui anŭn, tơ abih bang Phung Sang Ơi Adai bơjơnum glaĭ, laih anŭn abih bang leng kơ pơhiăp tơlơi tuai soh sel, laih anŭn hmâo ƀing gah rơngiao ƀôdah ƀing ƀu đaŏ yak mŭt, ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă gơñu či laĭ ƀing gih jing hưt? 
But if all prophesy, and some unbeliever or simple [person] come in, he is convicted of all, he is judged of all; @ Samơ̆ tơdah abih bang leng kơ laĭ lui hlâo, laih anŭn sa čô ƀu đaŏ ƀôdah sa čô gah rơngiao mŭt, ñu hmâo tơlơi kơčut laih anŭn tơlơi phat kơđi mơ̆ng abih bang tơlơi ñu hmư̆; 
the secrets of his heart are manifested; and thus, falling upon [his] face, he will do homage to God, reporting that God is indeed amongst you. @ Khul tơlơi hơgơ̆m amăng pran jua gơñu či pơrơđah hĭ, tui anŭn gơñu či kŭp ƀô̆ ƀơi lŏn, kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai, laih anŭn pơhaih:
“Ơi Adai dŏ tơ̆ng krah ƀing gih biă mă.”
What is it then, brethren? whenever ye come together, each [of you] has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edification. @ Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, hyư̆m ƀing gih khŏm ngă lĕ?

Brơi ƀing gih ngă abih bang tơlơi kiăng kơ pơdơ̆ng pơđĭ tơdruă ƀing gih. 
If any one speak with a tongue, [let it be] two, or at the most three, and separately, and let one interpret; @ Tơdah hmâo hlơi pơhiăp tơlơi tuai, brơi hmâo kơnơ̆ng dua ƀôdah lu hloh jing klâo čô đôč pơhiăp, laih anŭn rĭm čô pơhiăp djơ̆ tuôr ñu; laih anŭn khŏm hmâo pô pơblang.

And spirits of prophets are subject to prophets. @ Bơngăt jua ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo khŏm đup gưt kơ ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo. 
For God is not [a God] of disorder but of peace, as in all the assemblies of the saints. @ Yua kơ Ơi Adai ƀu jing Ơi Adai kơ tơlơi sŭl kŭl ôh; samơ̆ kơ tơlơi rơnŭk rơnua.

But if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in assembly. @ Tơdah hmâo tơlơi gơñu kiăng thâo hluh, brơi gơñu tơña rơkơi gơñu pơ sang. Yua kơ sa čô đah kơmơi pơhiăp amăng Phung Sang Ơi Adai jing sa tơlơi mlâo hañ biă mă.

If any one thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him recognise the things that I write to you, that it is [the] Lord's commandment. @ Tơdah hlơi pô pơmĭn ñu jing pô laĭ lui hlâo ƀôdah jing mơnuih hmâo tơlơi pha brơi gah mơyang, brơi ñu khŏm tŭ ư tơlơi kâo čih kơ ƀing gih anai jing tơlơi pơtă mơ̆ng Khua Yang.

So that, brethren, desire to prophesy, and do not forbid the speaking with tongues. @ Tui anŭn Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng kâo, čang kiăng bĕ kơ tơlơi dưi laĭ lui hlâo laih anŭn anăm khă ôh arăng pơhiăp tơlơi tuai.

For I delivered to you, in the first place, what also I had received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures; @  Yua kơ kâo hmâo pơtô laih kơ ƀing gih tơlơi yom hloh, tơlơi kâo pô ăt hmâo mă tŭ laih mơ̆n, anŭn jing Krist hmâo djai laih yua tơlơi soh ƀing ta tui hăng Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih,

and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. @ Ñu hmâo pơƀuh Ñu pô kơ Sêphas, laih anŭn kơ ƀing pluh dua čô khua ding kơna. 
Then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the most remain until now, but some also have fallen asleep. @ Laih anŭn Ñu pơƀuh brơi kơ rơbeh rơma rơtuh čô ƀing adơi ayŏng đaŏ amăng sa wơ̆t. Lu amăng ƀing anŭn ăt dŏ hơdip, samơ̆ hmâo đơđa djai laih.

But by God's grace I am what I am; and his grace, which [was] towards me, has not been vain; but I have laboured more abundantly than they all, but not *I*, but the grace of God which [was] with me. @ Samơ̆ hăng tơlơi pap Ơi Adai, kâo jing kar hăng kâo jing ră anai, laih anŭn tơlơi pap Ñu pha brơi kâo ƀu jing đôč đač ôh.

Now if Christ is preached that he is raised from among [the] dead, how say some among you that there is not a resurrection of [those that are] dead? @ Tui anŭn, tơdah arăng pơtô tơlơi Krist hmâo hơdip glaĭ mơ̆ng ƀing djai, hyư̆m hmâo đơđa amăng ƀing gih laĭ ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơdip glaĭ ôh kơ ƀing djai? 
But if there is not a resurrection of [those that are] dead, neither is Christ raised: @ Tơdah ƀing djai ƀu hơdip glaĭ ôh, Krist kŏn hmâo hơdip glaĭ lơi. 
but if Christ is not raised, then, indeed, vain also [is] our preaching, and vain also your faith. @ Laih anŭn tơdah Krist ƀu hơdip glaĭ ôh, tơlơi gơmơi pơtô jing đôč đač, laih anŭn tơlơi ƀing gih đaŏ ăt jing đôč đač mơ̆n. 
And we are found also false witnesses of God; for we have witnessed concerning God that he raised the Christ, whom he has not raised if indeed [those that are] dead are not raised. @ Hloh kơ anŭn dơ̆ng, tơdah sĭt ƀing djai ƀu hơdip glaĭ ôh laih anŭn ƀing ta laĭ Ơi Adai hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ Krist mơ̆ng ƀing djai jing ƀing ta ngă gơ̆ng jơlan ƀlor kơ Ơi Adai, yua kơ Ñu ƀu hmâo pơhơdip glaĭ Krist ôh. 
For if [those that are] dead are not raised, neither is Christ raised; @ Yua kơ tơdah ƀing djai ƀu hơdip glaĭ ôh, Yang Krist kŏn hơdip glaĭ lơi. 
but if Christ be not raised, your faith [is] vain; ye are yet in your sins. @ Tơdah Krist ƀu hơdip glaĭ ôh, tơlơi ƀing gih đaŏ ăt jing đôč đač mơ̆n laih anŭn ƀing gih ăt dŏ amăng tơlơi soh ƀing gih. 
Then indeed also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. @ Tui anŭn ƀing djai laih amăng Krist ăt răm rơngiă kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are [the] most miserable of all men. @ Tơdah amăng Krist ƀing ta kơnơ̆ng hmâo tơlơi čang rơmang amăng kơ tơlơi hơdip anai đôč, ƀing ta jing ƀing lăp kơ arăng pap mơñai hloh kơ abih bang mơnuih yơh.
(But now Christ is raised from among [the] dead, first-fruits of those fallen asleep. @ Samơ̆ Krist hmâo hơdip glaĭ laih mơ̆ng ƀing djai, Ñu jing boh hlâo hlang kơ ƀing djai.

[The] last enemy [that] is annulled [is] death. @ Pô ayăt hnal tuč Ñu či pơrai hĭ jing tơlơi djai.

one [the] sun's glory, and another [the] moon's glory, and another [the] stars' glory; for star differs from star in glory. @ Tơlơi guh kơang yang hrơi phara, tơlơi guh kơang yang blan phara, laih anŭn tơlơi guh kơang pơtŭ phara; laih anŭn tơlơi guh kơang sa sar pơtŭ anai phara hăng tơlơi guh kơang sa sar pơtŭ pơkŏn.
Thus also [is] the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruptibility. @ Tơlơi hơdip glaĭ kơ ƀing mơnuih djai ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n. Drơi jan arăng sai, thâo brŭ ro; samơ̆ drơi jan hơdip glaĭ, ƀu thâo brŭ ro ôh. 
It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. @ Hlăk arăng dơr lui, ñu sat laih anŭn tơdu; samơ̆ hlăk hơdip glaĭ ñu či jing hiam rŏ laih anŭn kơtang. 
It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body: if there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual [one]. @ Arăng sai ñu jing drơi jan asar; hơdip glaĭ ñu hmâo drơi jan mơyang. Tơdah hmâo drơi jan asar, tui anŭn ăt hmâo mơ̆n drơi jan mơyang. 
Thus also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul; the last Adam a quickening spirit. @ Tui anai Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih:
“Mơnuih tal blŭng hlâo, Ađam jing drơi jan hơdip; samơ̆ Ađam hnal tuč jing bơngăt mơyang pha brơi tơlơi hơdip.”
But that which is spiritual [was] not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual: @ Ƀu djơ̆ ôh gah bơngăt mơyang truh blŭng hlâo, samơ̆ gah asar; tơdơi kơ anŭn gah bơngăt mơyang truh. 
the first man out of [the] earth, made of dust; the second man, out of heaven. @ Mơnuih tal blŭng rai mơ̆ng lŏn, jing gah kơ lŏn, mơnuih tal dua rai mơ̆ng adai. 
Such as he made of dust, such also those made of dust; and such as the heavenly [one], such also the heavenly [ones]. @ Ƀing mơnuih gah kơ lŏn, gơñu jing kar hăng mơnuih mơ̆ng lŏn, ƀing mơnuih gah kơ adai, gơñu jing kar hăng Pô rai mơ̆ng adai. 
And as we have borne the image of the [one] made of dust, we shall bear also the image of the heavenly [one]. @ Kar hăng ƀing ta hmâo laih rup mơnuih gah kơ lŏn, ăt tui anŭn mơ̆n ƀing ta či hmâo rup mơnuih mơ̆ng adai.
But this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit God's kingdom, nor does corruption inherit incorruptibility. @ Ơ adơi ayŏng, kâo laĭ sĭt tơlơi anai kơ ƀing gih: asar laih anŭn drah ƀu dưi mă tŭ dêh čar pơtao Ơi Adai ôh, hơgĕt tơlơi thâo brŭ ro kŏn dưi mă tŭ lơi tơlơi ƀu thâo brŭ ro.

in an instant, in [the] twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and *we* shall be changed. @ blĭp hơmăr kar hăng añĕp mơta, hlăk hmư̆ asăp tơki hnal tuč. Hlăk anŭn ƀing djai či hơdip glaĭ ƀu thâo brŭ rai dơ̆ng ôh, laih anŭn ƀing ta či hmâo tơlơi hrih pơblih. 
For this corruptible must needs put on incorruptibility, and this mortal put on immortality. @ Yua kơ drơi jan thâo brŭ ro anai khŏm buh mă drơi jan ƀu thâo brŭ ro ôh; laih anŭn drơi jan thâo djai anai khŏm buh mă drơi jan ƀu thâo djai ôh. 
But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruptibility, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the word written: Death has been swallowed up in victory. @ Tơdah drơi jan thâo brŭ ro anai khŏm buh mă drơi jan ƀu thâo brŭ ro ôh, laih anŭn drơi jan thâo djai anai khŏm buh mă drơi jan ƀu thâo djai ôh, hlăk anŭn či jing krĕp djơ̆ Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih tui anai: “Tơlơi dưi lun hĭ laih tơlơi djai.”
Where, O death, [is] thy sting? where, O death, thy victory? @  “Ơ tơlơi djai, pơpă tơlơi dưi ŏng lĕ?
Ơ tơlơi djai, pơpă ia bih ŏng lĕ?”
Now the sting of death [is] sin, and the power of sin the law; @ Ia bih tơlơi djai jing tơlơi soh, laih anŭn tơlơi kơtang kơ tơlơi soh jing tơlơi juăt. 
but thanks to God, who gives us the victory by our Lord Jesus Christ. @ Samơ̆ bơni hơơč kơ Ơi Adai, Pô brơi kơ ƀing ta tơlơi dưi amăng Yêsu Krist Khua Yang ƀing ta.
So then, my beloved brethren, be firm, immovable, abounding always in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in [the] Lord. @ Hnŭn yơh, Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng kâo khăp hơeng, dŏ kơjăp bĕ anăm rŭng răng ôh, laih anŭn ngă bĕ bruă Khua Yang rơbeh blai nanao, yua kơ ƀing gih thâo laih bruă ƀing gih ngă amăng Khua Yang ƀu jing đôč đač ôh.
Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I directed the assemblies of Galatia, so do *ye* do also. @  Kơ bruă đup pơyơr kiăng djru ƀing rơgoh hiam, kar hăng kâo hmâo pơtă laih kơ Phung Sang Ơi Adai pơ Galati, brơi ƀing gih ăt ngă kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
On [the] first of [the] week let each of you put by at home, laying up [in] whatever [degree] he may have prospered, that there may be no collections when I come. @ Ƀơi hrơi tal sa rĭm hrơi kơ̆m, brơi rĭm čô amăng ƀing gih pơkom pioh bĕ sa črăn tui hăng ñu dưi, anăm ôh dŏ tơguan tơ kâo truh amơĭ kah nao ring đup pơyơr.

Now concerning the brother Apollos, I begged him much that he would go to you with the brethren; but it was not at all [his] will to go now; but he will come when he shall have good opportunity. @ Bơ kơ Apôlôs adơi ayŏng ƀing ta, kâo hmâo gir pơtrŭt laih ñu kiăng kơ ñu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng adơi ayŏng pơkŏn nao čuă ngui ƀing gih, samơ̆ ră anai ñu aka kiăng nao ôh.

(and our hope for you [is] sure;) or whether we are encouraged, [it is] for your encouragement and salvation: knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also of the encouragement. @ Tơlơi gơmơi čang rơmang ƀơi ƀing gih kơjăp biă mă; yua kơ gơmơi thâo tơdang ƀing gih tŭ tơlơi tơnap hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơmơi, kar kaĭ mơ̆n ƀing gih či hmâo tơlơi pơalum hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing gơmơi.
For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened [to us] in Asia, that we were excessively pressed beyond [our] power, so as to despair even of living. @  Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, gơmơi kiăng kơ ƀing gih thâo kơ tơlơi tơnap tap hmâo truh laih kơ ƀing gơmơi amăng čar Asi.

For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and sincerity before God, (not in fleshly wisdom but in God's grace,) we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly towards you. @ Tơlơi ngă kơ ƀing gơmơi dưi pơ-ư pô, anŭn yơh pran jua tơpă gơmơi gơ̆ng jơlan pơsĭt kơ tơlơi gơmơi dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă hăng tơlơi rơgoh hiam mơ̆ng Ơi Adai amăng lŏn tơnah anai, boh nik nak ƀơi anăp ƀing gih ƀu djơ̆ hăng tơlơi kơhnâo gah kơ asar đeh ôh, samơ̆ hăng tơlơi pap Ơi Adai.

And such confidence have we through the Christ towards God: @ Kơnang kơ Yang Krist, ƀing gơmơi đaŏ sĭt tui anŭn ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai. 
not that we are competent of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our competency [is] of God; @ Ƀu djơ̆ ôh ƀing gơmơi hmâo tơlơi rơgơi tơl dưi laĭ ƀing gơmơi dưi ngă sa mơta bruă tơbiă rai mơ̆ng gơmơi pô; samơ̆ tơlơi rơgơi gơmơi tơbiă rai mơ̆ng Ơi Adai. 
who has also made us competent, [as] ministers of [the] new covenant; not of letter, but of spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit quickens. @ Ñu yơh hmâo pha brơi ƀing gơmơi tơlơi dưi kiăng mă bruă kơ kơnol pơgop phrâo, ƀu djơ̆ kơnol pơgop ngă hăng boh hră ôh, samơ̆ hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam.

(But if the ministry of death, in letters, graven in stones, began with glory, so that the children of Israel could not fix their eyes on the face of Moses, on account of the glory of his face, [a glory] which is annulled; @  Tơdah bruă mă ba kơ tơlơi djai, arăng hmâo ƀoh boh hră ƀơi boh pơtâo ăt truh mơ̆n hăng tơlơi guh kơang, tơl ƀing Israel ƀu dưi lăng ƀô̆ mơta Môis ôh yua kơ mơñal, wơ̆t dah tơlơi mơñal anŭn dŏ kơnơ̆ng ƀiă đôč,

For if the ministry of condemnation [be] glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory. @ Yua kơ tơdah bruă mă ba truh kơ tơlơi klă kơđi ăt hmâo mơ̆n tơlơi guh kơang, tui anŭn bruă mă ba truh tơlơi yap tơpă či hmâo tơlơi guh kơang rơgao hloh dơ̆ng. 
For also that [which was] glorified is not glorified in this respect, on account of the surpassing glory. @ Sĭt yơh, amăng tơlơi anai, tơlơi hơgĕt hmâo laih tơlơi guh kơang ƀu či hmâo tơlơi guh kơang dơ̆ng tah gah anăp kơ tơlơi guh kơang prŏng hloh anai.

Having therefore such hope, we use much boldness: @ Yua kơ gơmơi hmâo tơlơi čang rơmang kar hăng anŭn, hnŭn yơh gơmơi hmâo tơlơi khĭn biă mă, 
and not according as Moses put a veil on his own face, so that the children of Israel should not fix their eyes on the end of that annulled. @ ƀu ngă ôh kar hăng Môis gom hĭ ƀô̆ mơta ñu hăng khăn, kiăng kơ ƀing Israel ƀu dưi ƀuh ôh tơlơi mơñal anŭn rơngiă ƀrư̆ ƀrư̆ laih anŭn thĕng hĭ. 
But their thoughts have been darkened, for unto this day the same veil remains in reading the old covenant, unremoved, which in Christ is annulled. @ Samơ̆ pran jua gơñu ăt dŏ khăng đôč; yua kơ hlŏng truh pơ hrơi anai, tơdang gơñu đŏk hră Pơgop Hơđăp, khăn anŭn ăt aka mă lui hĭ ôh mơ̆ng gơñu.

But when it shall turn to [the] Lord, the veil is taken away.) @ Samơ̆ tơdang sa čô mơnuih wơ̆t glaĭ kơ Khua Yang, khăn anŭn dưi mă lui hĭ.

But *we* all, looking on the glory of the Lord, with unveiled face, are transformed according to the same image from glory to glory, even as by [the] Lord [the] Spirit. @ Laih anŭn abih bang ƀing ta hăng ƀô̆ mơta ƀu gom ôh dŏ lăng kơ tơlơi guh kơang Khua Yang kar hăng amăng mơnĭl, hmâo tơlơi pơplih dưi jing hrup hăng rup Ñu, mơ̆ng tơlơi guh kơang anai truh tơlơi guh kơang pơkŏn. Yua kơ tơlơi anai tơbiă rai mơ̆ng Khua Yang, Pô jing Yang Bơngăt.
Therefore, having this ministry, as we have had mercy shewn us, we faint not. @ Yua mơ̆ng tơlơi pap drap Ơi Adai, ƀing gơmơi tŭ mă bruă mă anai, hnŭn yơh gơmơi ƀu hơtah hơtai ôh. 
But we have rejected the hidden things of shame, not walking in deceit, nor falsifying the word of God, but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every conscience of men before God. @ Ƀing gơmơi hơngah khul bruă ngă amăng tơlơi ƀu klă rơđah laih anŭn mlâo hañ.

in whom the god of this world has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the radiancy of the glad tidings of the glory of the Christ, who is [the] image of God, should not shine forth [for them]. @ Kơ ƀing ƀu đaŏ anŭn, yang rơnŭk anai ngă pơbum hĭ laih tơlơi pơmĭn gơñu, kiăng kơ gơñu ƀu thâo hluh ôh tơlơi bơngač mơ̆ng Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ tơlơi guh kơang Krist, Pô jing rup Ơi Adai.

And having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written, I have believed, therefore have I spoken; *we* also believe, therefore also we speak; @  Yua kơ gơmơi hmâo sa pran jua đaŏ kar hăng Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih: “Kâo hmâo đaŏ laih, hnŭn yơh kâo pơhiăp,” kar kaĭ mơ̆n ƀing gơmơi đaŏ, hnŭn yơh ƀing gơmơi pơhiăp,

For we know that if our earthly tabernacle house be destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. @ Yua kơ ƀing ta thâo tơdah sang khăn jing drơi jan ƀing ta ƀơi lŏn tơnah răm rai hĭ, ƀing ta hmâo sang hlŏng lar amăng adai, Ơi Adai pô pơdơ̆ng, ƀu djơ̆ hăng tơngan ană mơnuih ngă ôh. 
For indeed in this we groan, ardently desiring to have put on our house which [is] from heaven; @ Sĭt yơh amăng sang khăn anai ƀing ta ur krao, kiăng biă mă buh mă sang ƀing ta amăng adai. 
if indeed being also clothed we shall not be found naked. @ Tui anŭn giơ̆ng kơ ƀing ta buh mă sang anŭn, arăng ƀu ƀuh ƀing ta dŏ mơhlŭn dơ̆ng ôh. 
For indeed we who are in the tabernacle groan, being burdened; while yet we do not wish to be unclothed, but clothed, that [what is] mortal may be swallowed up by life. @ Yua kơ tơdang ƀing ta ăt dŏ amăng sang khăn anai, ƀing ta ur krao amăng tơlơi gleh kơtraŏ; ƀu djơ̆ ôh ƀing ta kiăng toh hĭ drơi jan asar đeh anai, samơ̆ ƀing ta kiăng buh mă drơi jan phrâo, kiăng kơ tơlơi hơdip či lun hĭ drơi jan thâo djai.

For we must all be manifested before the judgment-seat of the Christ, that each may receive the things [done] in the body, according to those he has done, whether [it be] good or evil. @ Yua kơ abih bang ƀing ta leng kơ khŏm dŏ ƀơi anăp gre phat kơđi Yang Krist, kiăng kơ rĭm čô dưi mă tŭ tui hăng ñu hmâo ngă laih tơlơi hiam ƀôdah tơlơi sat tơdang ñu dŏ hơdip amăng drơi jan anai.
Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord we persuade men, but have been manifested to God, and I hope also that we have been manifested in your consciences. @ Yua kơ ƀing gơmơi thâo hwĭ kơ Khua Yang, gơmơi pơtrŭt pơđur ƀing mơnuih pơkŏn.

For the love of the Christ constrains us, having judged this: that one died for all, then all have died; @ Tơlơi Krist khăp pơtrŭt kơtang ƀing gơmơi, yua kơ ƀing gơmơi thâo klă, sĭt sa čô hmâo djai laih yua kơ abih bang mơnuih, yua kơ anŭn yơh abih bang mơnuih leng kơ djai laih.

So that *we* henceforth know no one according to flesh; but if even we have known Christ according to flesh, yet now we know [him thus] no longer. @ Yua kơ anŭn, mơ̆ng anai pơ anăp, ƀing gơmơi ƀu pơkă hơnơ̆ng mơnuih tui hăng asar đeh ôh, wơ̆t dah hlâo adih ƀing gơmơi hmâo pơkă hơnơ̆ng laih Krist tui hăng asar đeh, samơ̆ ră anai gơmơi ƀu pơkă hơnơ̆ng Ñu kar hăng anŭn dơ̆ng ôh. 
So if any one [be] in Christ, [there is] a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold all things have become new: @ Tui anŭn, tơdah hlơi pô dŏ amăng Krist, ñu anŭn jing mơnuih hrih kơphrâo yơh, abih tơlơi so rơgao hĭ laih, anai nê, abih bang tơlơi leng kơ jing kơphrâo soh sel. 
and all things [are] of the God who has reconciled us to himself by [Jesus] Christ, and given to us the ministry of that reconciliation: @ Abih bang tơlơi anŭn rai mơ̆ng Ơi Adai, Pô hmâo pơrơnom glaĭ laih ƀing ta hăng Ñu amăng Yang Krist, laih anŭn hmâo jao laih kơ ƀing gơmơi bruă mă tơlơi pơrơnom.

and not by his coming only, but also through the encouragement with which he was encouraged as to you; relating to us your ardent desire, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I the more rejoiced. @ ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng yua kơ tơlơi ñu truh đôč ôh, samơ̆ ăt yua kơ mơ̆ng tơlơi pơalum ñu hmâo mă tŭ laih mơ̆ng ƀing gih.

For if also I grieved you in the letter, I do not regret [it], if even I have regretted it; for I see that that letter, if even [it were] only for a time, grieved you. @ Yua kơ wơ̆t dah kâo pơrơngot ƀing gih hăng hră kâo hmâo čih mơit laih kơ ƀing gih, kâo ƀu hơƀlŏk ôh tơlơi anŭn.

Now I rejoice, not that ye have been grieved, but that ye have been grieved to repentance; for ye have been grieved according to God, that in nothing ye might be injured by us. @ Ră anai kâo hmâo tơlơi mơak, ƀu djơ̆ ôh yua kơ ƀing gih hmâo tơlơi rơngot laih, samơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi rơngot ƀing gih hmâo ba ƀing gih kơ tơlơi kơhmal tơlơi soh; yua kơ ƀing gih hmâo tơlơi rơngot tui hăng Ơi Adai kiăng, hnŭn yơh, ƀing gơmơi ƀu hmâo ngă răm hơgĕt kơ ƀing gih ôh. 
For grief according to God works repentance to salvation, never to be regretted; but the grief of the world works death. @ Yua kơ tơlơi rơngot hơning tui hăng tơlơi Ơi Adai kiăng pơjing kơ tơlơi kơhmal kơ tơlơi soh kiăng kơ dưi hmâo tơlơi pơklaih, tơlơi anai ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơgĕt năng lăp kơ hơƀlŏk ôh; samơ̆ tơlơi rơngot hơning tui hăng lŏn tơnah ba truh kơ tơlơi djai. 
For, behold, this same thing, your being grieved according to God, how much diligence it wrought in *you*, but [what] excusing [of yourselves], but [what] indignation, but [what] fear, but [what] ardent desire, but [what] zeal, but [what] vengeance: in every way ye have proved yourselves to be pure in the matter. @ Hnŭn yơh, ƀing gih lăng bĕ, tơlơi rơngot tui hăng tơlơi Ơi Adai kiăng anŭn hmâo pơjing laih amăng ƀing gih: tơlơi hur har, tơlơi kiăng pơsĭt tơlơi ƀing gih jing jơngeh, tơlơi hơƀlŏk, tơlơi hwĭ bral, tơlơi čang kiăng biă mă, tơlơi tŏng ten, tơlơi pơkơhmal! Amăng djŏp mơta, ƀing gih hmâo pơrơđah laih ƀing gih pô ƀu hmâo tơlơi soh ôh amăng bruă anŭn. 
So then, if also I wrote to you, [it was] not for the sake of him that injured, nor for the sake of him that was injured, but for the sake of our diligent zeal for you being manifested to you before God. @ Tui anŭn, wơ̆t dah kâo hmâo čih laih kơ ƀing gih, samơ̆ ƀu djơ̆ kâo čih yua kơ pô ngă soh anŭn ôh, kŏn djơ̆ lơi yua kơ pô arăng hmâo pơsoh laih, samơ̆ kiăng kơ tơlơi hur har ƀing gih hăng gơmơi dưi pơrơđah brơi ƀing gih ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai. 
For this reason we have been encouraged. And we the rather rejoiced in our encouragement more abundantly by reason of the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all. @ Anŭn jing tơlơi pơalum ƀing gơmơi.

Because if I boasted to him anything about you, I have not been put to shame; but as we have spoken to you all things in truth, so also our boasting to Titus has been [the] truth; @ Tơdah kâo hmâo pơ-ư laih ƀing gih ƀơƀiă ƀơi anăp Tit, kâo ăt ƀu hmâo tơlơi mlâo hơgĕt ôh; samơ̆ kar hăng abih bang tơlơi gơmơi hmâo laĭ laih kơ ƀing gih jing tơlơi sĭt, ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n tơlơi ƀing gơmơi hmâo pơ-ư ƀơi anăp Tit hmâo pơrơđah laih jing tơlơi sĭt mơ̆n. 
and his affections are more abundantly towards you, calling to mind the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. @ Tui anŭn tơlơi ñu khăp kơ ƀing gih lu hloh, tơdang ñu hơdơr kơ tơlơi abih bang ƀing gih gưt asăp, laih anŭn tơlơi ƀing gih tŭ jum ñu hăng tơlơi hwĭ laih anŭn tơtư̆ drơi jan. 
I rejoice that in everything I am confident as to you. @ Kâo hơ̆k mơak, yua kơ kâo dưi kơnang kơ ƀing gih amăng djŏp mơta tơlơi.
But we make known to you, brethren, the grace of God bestowed in the assemblies of Macedonia; @  Ơ adơi ayŏng, gơmơi kiăng kơ ƀing gih thâo tơlơi pap Ơi Adai hmâo pha brơi laih kơ Phung Sang Ơi Adai amăng čar Masêđôn. 
that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty has abounded to the riches of their [free-hearted] liberality. @ Tơdang hmâo tơlơi lông lăng amăng tơlơi tơnap tap, samơ̆ gơñu bă blai tơlơi hơ̆k mơak. Amăng tơlơi ƀun rin biă mă, pran jua gơñu čơmah rơbeh blai jai hloh dơ̆ng. 
For according to [their] power, I bear witness, and beyond [their] power, [they were] willing of their own accord, @ Kâo dưi ngă gơ̆ng jơlan pơsĭt kơ ƀing gơñu, gơñu hmâo hơ̆k mơak pơđup pơyơr tui hăng tơlơi gơñu dưi, laih anŭn ngă rơgao hloh tơlơi gơñu dưi ngă dơ̆ng, 
begging of us with much entreaty [to give effect to] the grace and fellowship of the service which [was to be rendered] to the saints. @ ƀing gơñu kơwưh kơ ƀing gơmơi hăng abih pran jua kiăng biă mă gơmơi brơi ƀing gơñu dưi pơgop djru kơ ƀing rơgoh hiam. 
And not according as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us by God's will. @ Gơñu hmâo ngă rơgao hloh kơ tơlơi ƀing gơmơi čang rơmang, yua kơ blŭng hlâo gơñu hmâo pơyơr laih gơñu pô kơ Khua Yang, giơ̆ng anŭn kơ ƀing gơmơi, tui hăng tơlơi kiăng Ơi Adai. 
So that we begged Titus that, according as he had before begun, so he would also complete as to you this grace also; @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh, ƀing gơmơi hmâo pơtrŭt laih Tit ngă pơgiơ̆ng hĭ bruă tơlơi pap anai tơ̆ng krah ƀing gih, kar hăng ñu hmâo čơdơ̆ng ngă laih. 
but even as ye abound in every way, in faith, and word, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in love from you to us, that ye may abound in this grace also. @ Kar hăng ƀing gih hmâo ngă hiam biă mă laih amăng abih bang bruă: amăng tơlơi đaŏ, tơlơi pơhiăp, tơlơi thâo hluh, amăng abih tơlơi hur har, laih anŭn amăng tơlơi ƀing gih khăp kơ ƀing gơmơi. Brơi ƀing gih ăt ngă hiam hloh dơ̆ng amăng bruă tơlơi pap anai.
I do not speak as commanding [it], but through the zeal of others, and proving the genuineness of your love. @ Kâo laĭ tơlơi anai ƀu djơ̆ kiăng pơđar ƀing gih ôh, samơ̆ kâo kơnơ̆ng pơrơđah tơlơi hur har ƀing pơkŏn, kiăng pơlông lăng tơlơi khăp ƀing gih jing hur har dơ̆ pă. 
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that for your sakes he, being rich, became poor, in order that *ye* by *his* poverty might be enriched. @ Yua kơ ƀing gih thâo laih tơlơi pap Khua Yang ƀing ta Yêsu Krist: wơ̆t dah Ñu jing pơdrŏng, samơ̆ Ñu jing hĭ ƀun rin yua kơ ƀing gih, kiăng kơ mơ̆ng tơlơi ƀun rin Ñu, ƀing gih dưi jing pơdrŏng sah. 
And I give [my] opinion in this, for this is profitable for you who began before, not only to do, but also to be willing, a year ago. @ Anai tơlơi pơmĭn kâo kơ tơlơi anai: jing sa tơlơi hiam kơ ƀing gih, yua kơ mơ̆ng thŭn hlâo, ƀing gih ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng jing ƀing mơnuih blŭng hlâo ngă tơlơi anai ôh, samơ̆ ăt dŏ kiăng ngă dơ̆ng. 
But now also complete the doing of it; so that as [there was] the readiness to be willing, so also to complete out of what ye have. @ Ră anai pơgiơ̆ng hĭ bĕ bruă ƀing gih ngă, kar hăng ƀing gih hmâo hur har laih kiăng ngă, brơi ƀing gih pơgiơ̆ng bruă anŭn tui hăng tơlơi ƀing gih dưi. 
For if the readiness be there, [a man is] accepted according to what he may have, not according to what he has not. @ Tơdah sa čô mơnuih pơyơr hăng pran jua khăp, mơnơ̆ng pơyơr anŭn či dưi mă tŭ, tui hăng tơlơi ƀing gơñu hmâo, ƀu djơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi gơñu ƀu hmâo ôh.
For [it is] not in order that there may be ease for others, and for you distress, @ Kâo ƀu kiăng ôh ngă pơdjhul kơ ƀing pơkŏn, laih anŭn ngă pơkơtraŏ kơ ƀing gih, samơ̆ kiăng hmâo tơlơi bơkơnar đôč. 
but [on the principle] of equality; in the present time your abundance for their lack, that their abundance may be for your lack, so that there should be equality. @ Tơlơi ƀing gih hmâo rơbeh lu ră anai či pơdjơ̆p hĭ tơlơi gơñu kơƀah, laih anŭn kiăng kơ tơlơi ƀing gơñu hmâo rơbeh lu či pơdjơ̆p tơlơi ƀing gih kơƀah.

“Hlơi pô pơƀŭt pioh lu ăt ƀu rơbeh ôh,
Laih anŭn hlơi pô pơƀŭt pioh ƀiă ăt ƀu kơƀah mơ̆n.”
But thanks [be] to God, who gives the same diligent zeal for you in the heart of Titus. @ Kâo bơni kơ Ơi Adai, Pô hmâo dưm laih amăng pran jua Tit tơlơi hur har thâo bơngơ̆t kơ ƀing gih kar hăng kâo mơ̆n. 
For he received indeed the entreaty, but, being full of zeal, he went of his own accord to you; @ Yua kơ ƀu djơ̆ ñu kơnơ̆ng tŭ tơlơi gơmơi rơkâo đôč ôh, samơ̆ ñu pô mơ̆n hur har kiăng nao čuă ƀing gih. 
but we have sent with him the brother whose praise [is] in the glad tidings through all the assemblies; @ Ƀing gơmơi ăt mơit nao mơ̆n sa čô adơi ayŏng nao hrŏm hăng Tit, jing pô hmâo tơlơi hing ang amăng abih bang Phung Sang Ơi Adai yua kơ tơlơi ñu pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam. 
and not only [so], but [is] also chosen by the assemblies as our fellow-traveller with this grace, ministered by us to the glory of the Lord himself, and [a witness of] our readiness; @ Ƀu djơ̆ kơnơ̆ng hơdôm anŭn đôč ôh, samơ̆ Phung Sang Ơi Adai hmâo ruah laih ñu brơi hyu hrŏm hăng ƀing gơmơi amăng bruă tơlơi pap gơmơi hlăk dŏ ngă anai, kiăng ngă guh kơang Khua Yang, laih anŭn kiăng pơrơđah pran jua hiam ƀing gơmơi.
avoiding this, that any one should blame us in this abundance [which is] administered by us; @ Ƀing gơmơi ƀu kiăng ôh arăng jăm ƀuah ƀing gơmơi amăng tơlơi wai lăng mơnơ̆ng brơi pap lu rơbeh anai;

And we have sent with them our brother whom we have often proved to be of diligent zeal in many things, and now more diligently zealous through the great confidence [he has] as to you. @ Ƀing gơmơi ăt mơit mơ̆n adơi ayŏng ƀing gơmơi nao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu, pô gơmơi hmâo lông lăng laih lu wơ̆t laih anŭn ƀuh ñu hur har amăng lu mơta bruă, samơ̆ ră anai ñu hur har hloh dơ̆ng yua kơ ñu đaŏ biă mă kơ ƀing gih. 
Whether as regards Titus, [he is] my companion and fellow-labourer in your behalf; or our brethren, [they are] deputed messengers of assemblies, Christ's glory. @ Bơ kơ Tit, ñu jing gơyut mă bruă laih anŭn pô mă bruă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng kâo kiăng djru ƀing gih.

Shew therefore to them, before the assemblies, the proof of your love, and of our boasting about you. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh, ƀơi anăp Phung Sang Ơi Adai, pơrơđah pơsĭt bĕ tơlơi khăp ƀing gih, laih anŭn tơlơi gơmơi pơ-ư kơ ƀing gơmơi pô yua kơ ƀing gih.
For concerning the ministration which [is] for the saints, it is superfluous my writing to you. @ Ră anai ƀu yom ôh kơ kâo čih hră kơ ƀing gih kơ tơlơi pơyơr mơnơ̆ng djru kơ ƀing rơgoh hiam dơ̆ng. 
For I know your readiness, which I boast of as respects you to Macedonians, that Achaia is prepared since a year ago, and the zeal [reported] of you has stimulated the mass [of the brethren]. @ Yua kơ kâo thâo laih tơlơi ƀing gih hur har kiăng djru.

But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect, in order that, as I have said, ye may be prepared; @ Samơ̆ kâo hmâo pơkiaŏ laih ƀing adơi ayŏng anai nao, kiăng kơ tơlơi gơmơi pơ-ư kơ ƀing gih ƀu jing hĭ đôč đač ôh amăng bruă anai, laih anŭn kiăng kơ ƀing gih prăp rơmet lui hlâo, tui hăng tơlơi kâo hmâo laĭ laih;

I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you. @ Tui anŭn, kâo pơmĭn khŏm pơtrŭt ƀing adơi ayŏng nao hlâo pơ ƀing gih, laih anŭn prăp rơmet lui hlâo gơnam đup pơyơr ƀing gih hmâo ƀuăn laih, kiăng kơ bruă đup pơyơr anai hmâo tơlơi prăp pre lui kar hăng gơnam pha brơi mơ̆ng pran jua čơmah ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ tơlơi pơgŏ ôh.
But this [is true], he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in [the spirit of] blessing shall reap also in blessing: @ Brơi ƀing gih thâo tơlơi anai: hlơi pô sai ƀiă či hơpuă ƀiă, laih anŭn hlơi pô sai lu či hơpuă lu.

But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work: @ Ơi Adai dưi pha brơi kơ ƀing gih tơlơi pap rơbeh rơbai, kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi hmâo djŏp mơta mơnơ̆ng ƀing gih kiăng, laih anŭn hmâo rơbeh rơbai dơ̆ng kiăng ngă lu mơta bruă hiam.

Do ye look at what concerns appearance? If any one has confidence in himself that he is of Christ, let him think this again in himself, that even as he [is] of Christ, so also [are] we. @ Ƀing gih kơnơ̆ng ƀuh mơnơ̆ng ƀơi anăp mơta ƀing gih đôč.

For and if I should boast even somewhat more abundantly of our authority, which the Lord has given [to us] for building up and not for your overthrowing, I shall not be put to shame; @ Wơ̆t dah kâo pơ-ư kơ kâo pô rơgao hơnơ̆ng ƀiă yua kơ tơlơi dưi Khua Yang hmâo brơi laih kơ kâo kiăng djru ƀing gih rai kơ prŏng ƀu djơ̆ kiăng pơrai pơglưh hĭ ƀing gih ôh, kâo ăt ƀu mlâo ôh. 
that I may not seem as if I was frightening you by letters: @ Kâo ƀu kiăng ôh arăng pơmĭn kâo pơhwĭ ƀing gih hăng hră kâo mơit. 
because his letters, he says, [are] weighty and strong, but his presence in the body weak, and his speech naught. @ Yua kơ hmâo pô laĭ: “Hră ñu mơit jing kơtraŏ laih anŭn khăng khơ̆t, samơ̆ tơdah ƀuh ƀô̆ mơta ñu jing tơdu laih anŭn tơlơi ñu pơhiăp ƀu yom ôh.” 
Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters [when] absent, such also present in deed. @ Brơi kơ ƀing pơhiăp tui anŭn khŏm thâo hluh hyư̆m tơlơi ƀing gơmơi čih amăng hră hlăk gơmơi rơkut, ƀing gơmơi ăt či ngă tui anŭn mơ̆n tơdah gơmơi ƀuh ƀô̆ mơta.
For we dare not class ourselves or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves; but these, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are not intelligent. @ Ƀing gơmơi ƀu khĭn pơkă ƀôdah pơhmô gơmơi pô hăng ƀing mơnuih pơ-ư kơ gơñu pô.

But he that boasts, let him boast in the Lord. @ “Hlơi pô pơ-ư kơ ñu pô brơi ñu pơ-ư bĕ ñu pô amăng Khua Yang.” 
For not *he* that commends himself is approved, but whom the Lord commends. @ Yua kơ ƀu djơ̆ ôh mơnuih pơ-ư kơ ñu pô či hmâo tơlơi arăng tŭ ư, samơ̆ kơ pô Khua Yang bơni yơh.

For I am jealous as to you with a jealousy [which is] of God; for I have espoused you unto one man, to present [you] a chaste virgin to Christ. @ Kâo gar kơ ƀing gih kar hăng tơlơi gar Ơi Adai.

But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craft, [so] your thoughts should be corrupted from simplicity as to the Christ. @ Samơ̆ kâo hwĭ, kar hăng ala hmâo plư laih HʼÊwa hăng tơlơi ñu pleč ƀlor hyư̆m pă, ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n tơlơi pơmĭn ƀing gih či weh đuaĭ hĭ mơ̆ng tơlơi tơpă sĭt laih anŭn rơgoh hơčih ƀing gih hmâo jao laih gih pô kơ Yang Krist. 
For if indeed he that comes preaches another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or ye get a different Spirit, which ye have not got, or a different glad tidings, which ye have not received, ye might well bear with [it]. @ Yua kơ tơdah hmâo hlơi rai pơtô kơ ƀing gih sa Yêsu pơkŏn phara hăng Pô ƀing gơmơi hmâo pơtô laih, ƀôdah tơdah ƀing gih hmâo mă tŭ laih sa yang pơkŏn phara hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam ƀing gih hmâo tŭ mă laih, ƀôdah tơdah ƀing gih tŭ mă sa Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam pơkŏn phara hăng Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam ƀing gih hmâo tŭ mă laih, sĭt yơh ƀing gih ăt tañ tŭ tơlơi anŭn mơ̆n!

But if [I am] a simple person in speech, yet not in knowledge, but in everything making [the truth] manifest in all things to you. @ Wơ̆t dah kâo pơhiăp ƀu hiam ôh, samơ̆ kâo hmâo tơlơi thâo hluh, amăng djŏp mơta tơlơi ƀing gơmơi hmâo pơrơđah klă laih tơlơi anŭn ƀơi tơ̆ng krah abih bang mơnuih.
Have I committed sin, abasing myself in order that *ye* might be exalted, because I gratuitously announced to you the glad tidings of God? @ Kâo hmâo tơlơi soh glaĭ hơgĕt mơ̆ tơdang kâo luă gŭ kâo pô kiăng kơ ƀing gih dưi hmâo tơlơi pŭ pơđĭ?

And being present with you and lacking, I did not lazily burden any one, (for the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied what I lacked,) and in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and will keep myself. @ Laih anŭn tơdang dŏ hrŏm hăng ƀing gih, hlăk kâo kơƀah mơnơ̆ng, kâo ƀu hmâo pơkơtraŏ ƀing gih ôh.

Why? because I do not love you? God knows. @ Hyư̆m? Yua kơ kâo ƀu khăp kơ ƀing gih hă? Ơi Adai thâo kâo khăp kơ ƀing gih!
But what I do, I will also do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those wishing [for] an opportunity, that wherein they boast they may be found even as we. @ Samơ̆ tơlơi kâo hlăk ngă, kâo či ngă dơ̆ng, kiăng pơglưh hĭ mông gal kơ ƀing mơnuih hơduah mông gal kiăng pơđĭ gơñu pô, gơñu laĭ gơñu ăt jing kar hăng ƀing gơmơi mơ̆n. 
For such [are] false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. @ Yua kơ ƀing anŭn jing ƀing khua ding kơna ƀlor, ƀing mă bruă apah pleč ƀlor, gơñu ngă ƀlor mă gơñu pô jing ƀing khua ding kơna Yang Krist.

It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works. @ Tui anŭn ƀu hmâo dŏ kơtuă ôh tơdah ƀing ding kơna Satan ngă ƀlor mă ñu pô jing ding kơna kơ tơlơi tơpă.

Again I say, Let not any one think me to be a fool; but if otherwise, receive me then even as a fool, that *I* also may boast myself some little. @ Kâo laĭ glaĭ dơ̆ng, anăm hlơi pơmĭn kơ kâo jing kar hăng mơnuih mlŭk ôh; samơ̆ wơ̆t dah ƀing gih pơmĭn tui anŭn, tŭ ư bĕ kâo kar hăng sa čô mơnuih mlŭk, kiăng kơ kâo ăt dưi pơ-ư kâo pô ƀiă.

nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [who were] apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus. @ Kâo kŏn đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem lơi kiăng kơ bưp ƀing khua ding kơna hlâo kơ kâo, samơ̆ kâo nao pơ čar Arabi mơtam; giơ̆ng anŭn kâo wơ̆t glaĭ plei Damas dơ̆ng. 
Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days; @ Klâo thŭn tơdơi mơ̆ng anŭn, kâo đĭ nao plei Yêrusalem kiăng čuă ngui Sêphas laih anŭn kâo dŏ glaĭ hăng ñu pluh rơma hrơi.

Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn, kâo nao pơ čar Siri laih anŭn čar Silisi. 
But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea which [are] in Christ; @ Hlăk anŭn lu Phung Sang Ơi Adai kơ Krist amăng Čar Yuđa aka thâo krăn ƀô̆ mơta kâo ôh. 
only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he ravaged: @ Kơnơ̆ng ƀing gơñu hmư̆ hing arăng laĭ: “Pô ngă sat kơ ƀing ta hlâo dih, ră anai dŏ pơtô tơlơi đaŏ hlâo dih ñu kiăng pơrai.” 
and they glorified God in me. @ Tui anŭn, ƀing gơñu pơpŭ bơni kơ Ơi Adai yua kơ kâo.
Then after a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with [me]; @  Pluh pă thŭn tơdơi, kâo đĭ nao pơ plei Yêrusalem dơ̆ng hrŏm hăng Barnabas, djă ba Tit hrŏm hăng kâo mơ̆n. 
and I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations, but privately to those conspicuous [among them], lest in any way I run or had run in vain; @ Kâo đĭ nao pơ anŭn tui hăng tơlơi Ơi Adai bơrơđah, laih anŭn kâo pơblang brơi kơ ƀing gơñu Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kâo hmâo pơtô laih tơ̆ng krah ƀing djuai tuai.

and [it was] on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage; @ Samơ̆ hmâo đơđa ƀing adơi ayŏng đaŏ ƀlor klĕ mŭt amăng ƀing gơmơi, lăng sŭ tơlơi rơngai ƀing gơmơi hmâo amăng Krist Yêsu, kiăng pơjing ƀing gơmơi jing hlŭn gơñu. 
to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you. @ Ƀing gơmơi ƀu tui gưt gơñu ôh, wơ̆t dah kơnơ̆ng ƀiă mơnĭt đôč, kiăng kơ tơlơi sĭt kơ Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam dưi dŏ kơjăp amăng ƀing gih.
But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man's person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing; @  Bơ kơ ƀing rŏ dah jing akŏ wai lăng (hơgĕt gơñu jing hlâo dih tơlơi anŭn ƀu yom kơ kâo ôh, Ơi Adai ƀu pơkah phara ôh), kâo laĭ, ƀing akŏ wai lăng anŭn ƀu hmâo djru thim tơlơi hơgĕt kơ kâo ôh. 
but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision, @ Samơ̆ kơđai glaĭ, tơ gơñu ƀuh Ơi Adai hmâo jao laih kơ kâo bruă pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ ƀing ƀu khăt klĭ ôh, kar hăng Ơi Adai hmâo jao laih kơ Pêtrôs bruă pơtô Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam kơ ƀing khăt klĭ. 
(for he that wrought in Peter for [the] apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles,) @ Yua kơ Ơi Adai, Pô hmâo mă bruă laih amăng Pêtrôs, pơjing ñu jing khua ding kơna kơ ƀing khăt klĭ, ăt hmâo mă bruă laih mơ̆n amăng kâo laih anŭn pơjing kâo khua ding kơna kơ ƀing djuai tuai. 
and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas [the] right hands of fellowship, that *we* [should go] to the nations, and *they* to the circumcision; @ Laih anŭn tơ gơñu thâo hluh tơlơi pap Ơi Adai hmâo brơi laih kơ kâo, Yakơ, Sêphas, laih anŭn Yôhan, ƀing arăng pơpŭ yap kar hăng tơmeh, hmâo jao tơngan hơnuă pơgop hăng kâo laih anŭn Barnabas, kiăng brơi kơ ƀing gơmơi nao pơ ƀing djuai tuai, bơ ƀing gơñu nao pơ ƀing khăt klĭ. 
only that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do. @ Ƀing gơñu kơnơ̆ng rơkâo kơ ƀing gơmơi sa mơta bruă đôč, anŭn jing khŏm hơdơr djru kơ ƀing ƀun rin, jing bruă ƀing gơmơi hmâo ngă laih hăng tơlơi hur har.
But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to [the] face, because he was to be condemned: @ Samơ̆ tơ Sêphas truh pơ plei Antiôs, kâo pơkơdơ̆ng hăng ñu ƀơi anăp lu mơnuih, yua kơ ñu lăp kơ ƀuah. 
for before that certain came from James, he ate with [those of] the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those of [the] circumcision; @ Yua kơ hlâo kơ ƀing mơnuih Yakơ pơkiaŏ rai truh, ñu ƀơ̆ng huă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing djuai tuai; samơ̆ tơ ƀing gơñu truh, ñu kơdŭn laih anŭn pơčơlah dŏ hĭ phara, yua kơ hwĭ kơ ƀing khăt klĭ. 
and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation. @ Abih bang ƀing Yuđa pơkŏn kar kaĭ mơ̆n hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu ngă tơlơi ƀu tơpă sĭt, tơl wơ̆t Barnabas pô ăt kar kaĭ mơ̆n pơhluai tui tơlơi pơrup mă ƀing gơñu. 
But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before all, If *thou*, being a Jew, livest as the nations and not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize? @ Samơ̆ tơ kâo ƀuh ƀing gơñu ƀu ngă tơlơi tơpă sĭt tui hăng tơlơi sĭt mơ̆ng Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam ôh, kâo laĭ kơ Sêphas ƀơi anăp abih bang ƀing gơñu: “Tơdah ih jing mơnuih Yuđa, samơ̆ dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă kar hăng mơnuih tuai, ƀu djơ̆ kar hăng mơnuih Yuđa ôh, hyư̆m ih dưi pơgŏ ƀing djuai tuai dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă kar hăng ƀing mơnuih Yuđa?”

but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of works of law [nor] but by the faith of Jesus Christ, *we* also have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on the principle of [the] faith of Christ; and not of works of law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be justified. @ Samơ̆ ƀing gơmơi thâo Ơi Adai yap mơnuih tơpă ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ khul bruă ngă tui tơlơi juăt ôh, samơ̆ mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ kơ Yêsu Krist.

Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness. @  Kar hăng Abraham: “đaŏ kơ Ơi Adai, laih anŭn Ơi Adai yap ñu jing tơpă.” 
Know then that they that are on the principle of faith, these are Abraham's sons; @ Tui anŭn, brơi kơ ƀing gih thâo hluh ƀing hmâo tơlơi đaŏ yơh jing ană tơčo Abraham sĭt. 
and the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the nations on the principle of faith, announced beforehand the glad tidings to Abraham: In thee all the nations shall be blessed. @ Laih anŭn Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo laĭ laih hlâo kơ tơlơi Ơi Adai či yap tơpă ƀing djuai tuai hăng tơlơi đaŏ, tui anŭn hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp anŭn hmâo pơtô laih kơ Abraham Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam anai, laĭ: “Amăng ih yơh abih bang djuai mơnuih či hmâo tơlơi mơyun hiam.” 
So that they who are on the principle of faith are blessed with believing Abraham. @ Hnŭn yơh, hlơi pô đaŏ ñu hmâo tơlơi mơyun hiam hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Abraham, pô hmâo laih tơlơi đaŏ.
For as many as are on the principle of works of law are under curse. For it is written, Cursed is every one who does not continue in all things which [are] written in the book of the law to do them; @  Yua kơ abih bang hlơi pô kơnang kơ bruă ngă tui tơlơi juăt ñu dŏ gah yŭ tơlơi hơtơ̆m pah yơh; yua kơ hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo čih laih: “Lăp hơtơ̆m pah yơh kơ hlơi pô ƀu ngă tui abih bang tơlơi hmâo čih laih amăng hơdrôm hră tơlơi juăt.” 
but that by law no one is justified with God [is] evident, because The just shall live on the principle of faith; @ Sĭt klă rơđah biă mă, ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô dưi hmâo tơlơi yap tơpă ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt; yua kơ “Pô tơpă či hơdip hăng tơlơi đaŏ.”

Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed [is] every one hanged upon a tree,) @  Krist hmâo song mă laih ƀing ta mơ̆ng tơlơi hơtơ̆m pah tơbiă rai mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt, yua kơ Ñu hmâo jing laih pô arăng hơtơ̆m pah yua kơ ƀing ta — yua kơ boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai hmâo či laih: “Hơtơ̆m pah hĭ kơ Pô arăng yol ƀơi kơyâo” — 
that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. @ kiăng kơ tơlơi mơyun hiam Ơi Adai hmâo ƀuăn laih kơ Abraham dưi truh kơ ƀing djuai tuai amăng Krist Yêsu, tui anŭn mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ ƀing ta dưi mă tŭ Yang Bơngăt Hiam jing tơlơi Ơi Adai hmâo ƀuăn laih.
Brethren, (I speak according to man,) even man's confirmed covenant no one sets aside, or adds other dispositions to. @ Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, kâo pơhiăp kar hăng arăng juăt pơhiăp tui anai: Tơ dua čô mơnuih hmâo pơjing laih kơnol pơgop, ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi lơ̆m lui ôh, ƀôdah thim dơ̆ng. 
But to Abraham were the promises addressed, and to his seed: he does not say, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed; which is Christ. @ Kơ khul tơlơi ƀuăn Ơi Adai hmâo brơi laih kơ Abraham laih anŭn kơ ană tơčo ñu. Hră Ơi Adai pơhiăp ƀu laĭ ôh: “Kơ ƀing ană tơčo”, kar hăng laĭ djơ̆ kơ lu mơnuih, samơ̆ laĭ “kơ ană tơčo ih”, kar hăng laĭ djơ̆ kơ sa čô mơnuih, Pô anŭn jing Yang Krist. 
Now I say this, A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which took place four hundred and thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect. @ Tơlơi kâo kiăng laĭ tui anai: Tơlơi juăt, jing tơlơi truh tơdơi kơ kơnol pơgop pă rơtuh klâo pluh thŭn, ƀu dưi lui hĭ ôh tơlơi akă kơnol Ơi Adai hmâo pơjing laih mơ̆ng hlâo, kŏn dưi ngă brơi tơlơi ƀuăn jing hĭ đôč đač mơ̆n. 
For if the inheritance [be] on the principle of law, [it is] no longer on the principle of promise; but God gave it in grace to Abraham by promise. @ Yua kơ tơdah mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt dưi mă tŭ kong ngăn, ñu ƀu djơ̆ yua kơ mơ̆ng tơlơi ƀuăn dơ̆ng ôh. Samơ̆ Ơi Adai hmâo yua tơlơi ƀuăn kiăng pha brơi tơlơi pap kơ Abraham.
Why then the law? It was added for the sake of transgressions, until the seed came to whom the promise was made, ordained through angels in [the] hand of a mediator. @ Tui anŭn tơlơi juăt pioh ngă hơgĕt? Tơlơi kơñăm kơ tơlơi juăt anŭn jing kiăng bơrơđah brơi tơlơi soh arăng ngă, tơl hrơi ană tơčo anŭn truh, kơ Pô anŭn yơh hmâo tơlơi ƀuăn brơi laih. Ơi Adai hmâo yua ƀing ling jang ba tơlơi juăt găn sa čô pô dŏ kơplah. 
But a mediator is not of one, but God is one. @ Pô dŏ kơplah ƀu jing pô pơala brơi kơ sa gah ôh, samơ̆ Ơi Adai hmâo kơnơ̆ng hasa đôč.
[Is] then the law against the promises of God? Far be the thought. For if a law had been given able to quicken, then indeed righteousness were on the principle of law; @ Tui anŭn tơlơi juăt pơkơdơ̆ng hăng khul tơlơi Ơi Adai ƀuăn mơ̆? Ư ưh, ƀu hmâo ôh! Yua kơ tơdah tơlơi juăt hmâo pha brơi laih dưi brơi tơlơi hơdip, tui anŭn tơlơi tơpă či rai mơ̆ng tơlơi juăt. 
but the scripture has shut up all things under sin, that the promise, on the principle of faith of Jesus Christ, should be given to those that believe. @ Samơ̆ Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp hmâo laĭ abih bang tơlơi leng kơ dŏ krư̆ gah yŭ tơlơi dưi kơ tơlơi soh, kiăng kơ mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ kơ Yêsu Krist, Ơi Adai pha brơi tơlơi ƀuăn kơ ƀing đaŏ.
But before faith came, we were guarded under law, shut up to faith [which was] about to be revealed. @ Hlâo kơ tơlơi đaŏ truh, ƀing ta dŏ gah yŭ tơlơi juăt krư̆ laih anŭn wai lăng, tơl truh hrơi tơlơi đaŏ hmâo bơrơđah rai. 
So that the law has been our tutor up to Christ, that we might be justified on the principle of faith. @ Tui anŭn tơlơi juăt jing kar hăng pô pơtô wai lăng atăt ba ƀing ta tơl Krist truh, kiăng ƀing ta dưi hmâo tơlơi yap tơpă mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ. 
But, faith having come, we are no longer under a tutor; @ Samơ̆ tơ tơlơi đaŏ truh laih, ƀing ta ƀu dŏ gah yŭ kơ pô pơtô wai lăng anŭn dơ̆ng tah.
for ye are all God's sons by faith in Christ Jesus. @ Yua kơ mơ̆ng tơlơi đaŏ kơ Krist Yêsu, abih bang ƀing gih leng kơ jing hĭ ană Ơi Adai. 
For ye, as many as have been baptised unto Christ, have put on Christ. @ Kar hăng lu mơnuih amăng ƀing gih hmâo tŭ laih ƀatem amăng Krist, leng kơ buh mă Yang Krist laih. 
There is no Jew nor Greek; there is no bondman nor freeman; there is no male and female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus: @ Ƀu hmâo tơlơi yap phara dơ̆ng ôh ƀing Yuđa hăng ƀing Grek, ƀing hlŭn hăng ƀing rơngai, ƀing đah rơkơi hăng ƀing đah kơmơi; yua kơ abih bang ƀing gih leng kơ jing laih sa amăng Krist Yêsu. 
but if *ye* [are] of Christ, then ye are Abraham's seed, heirs according to promise. @ Laih anŭn tơdah ƀing gih lơ̆m kơ Krist, ƀing gih jing ƀing ană tơčo Abraham, jing ƀing mă tŭ kong ngăn tui hăng tơlơi ƀuăn.
Now I say, As long as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all; @ Kâo kiăng laĭ, pô tŭ mă kong ngăn, tơdang ñu dŏ čơđai ƀu hmâo tơlơi phara ôh hăng sa čô hlŭn, wơ̆t dah ñu jing khua kơ abih bang kong ngăn. 
but he is under guardians and stewards until the period fixed by the father. @ Samơ̆ ñu khŏm dŏ gah yŭ tơlơi dưi ƀing rong ba laih anŭn ƀing wai lăng dram gơnam ñu tơl truh hrơi ama ñu hmâo pơkơčah laih. 
So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the principles of the world; @ Ƀing ta ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n; tơdang ƀing ta ăt dŏ čơđai, ƀing ta jing hlŭn kơ ƀing yang đêl mơda wai lăng lŏn tơnah. 
but when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, come of woman, come under law, @ Samơ̆ tơ rơnŭk pơkơčah truh laih, Ơi Adai pơkiaŏ rai ană Ñu, tơkeng rai mơ̆ng sa čô đah kơmơi, tơkeng gah yŭ tơlơi juăt, 
that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive sonship. @ kiăng kơ song mă ƀing dŏ gah yŭ tơlơi juăt, yua kơ anŭn ƀing ta dưi mă tŭ tơlơi dưi jing ană rong ba.
But because ye are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father. @ Yua kơ ƀing gih jing ană, hnŭn yơh Ơi Adai hmâo pơkiaŏ rai laih Yang Bơngăt Hiam Ană Ñu dŏ amăng pran jua ƀing ta, iâu đĭ “Aba, Ama!” 
So thou art no longer bondman, but son; but if son, heir also through God. @ Tui anŭn, mơ̆ng tơlơi pap Ơi Adai, ƀing gih ƀu jing hlŭn dơ̆ng ôh, samơ̆ jing ană; laih anŭn tơdah jing ană, jing pô mă tŭ kong ngăn mơ̆n.
But then indeed, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods; @ Hlâo adih hlăk ƀing gih aka thâo krăn Ơi Adai ôh, ƀing gih jing laih hlŭn kơ ƀing yang ƀu hmâo sĭt ôh. 
but now, knowing God, but rather being known by God, how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly principles to which ye desire to be again anew in bondage? @ Samơ̆ ră anai ƀing gih thâo krăn Ơi Adai laih, biă mă Ơi Adai thâo krăn laih ƀing gih, tui anŭn hyư̆m ƀing gih kiăng wơ̆t glaĭ yang rơbang tơdu ƀu ai, ƀun rin anŭn?

For it is written that Abraham had two sons; one of the maid servant, and one of the free woman. @ Yua kơ hmâo čih laih: Abraham hmâo dua čô ană đah rơkơi, sa čô mơ̆ng đah kơmơi hlŭn, sa čô mơ̆ng đah kơmơi rơngai. 
But he [that was] of the maid servant was born according to flesh, and he [that was] of the free woman through the promise. @ Samơ̆ ană đah kơmơi hlŭn tơkeng tui hăng asar đeh, ană đah kơmơi rơngai tơkeng tui hăng tơlơi ƀuăn. 
Which things have an allegorical sense; for these are two covenants: one from mount Sinai, gendering to bondage, which is Hagar. @ Tơlơi anŭn jing kar hăng: dua čô đah kơmơi anŭn jing dua kơnol ƀuăn. Sa jing kơnol pơgop tơbiă mơ̆ng čư̆ Sinai, tơkeng kơ ƀing ană jing hlŭn. Ñu anŭn HʼAga. 
For Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to Jerusalem which [is] now, for she is in bondage with her children; @ HʼAga jing čư̆ Sinai amăng čar Arabi, kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n ñu bơkơnar hăng plei Yêrusalem ră anai, yua kơ ñu hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ană bă ñu leng kơ jing hlŭn. 
but the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother. @ Samơ̆ Plei Yêrusalem hăng adai jing plei rơngai, ñu jing amĭ ƀing ta. 
For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break out and cry, thou that travailest not; because the children of the desolate are more numerous than [those] of her that has a husband. @ Yua kơ Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp čih:

But *ye*, brethren, after the pattern of Isaac, are children of promise. @ Ơ ƀing adơi ayŏng, ƀing gih jing kar hăng Isak, jing ƀing ană mơ̆ng tơlơi ƀuăn. 
But as then he that was born according to flesh persecuted him [that was born] according to Spirit, so also [it is] now. @ Samơ̆ kar hăng rơnŭk anŭn, ană tơkeng tui hăng asar đeh ngă sat kơ ană tơkeng tui hăng Yang Bơngăt Hiam, ră anai ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n. 
But what says the scripture? Cast out the maid servant and her son; for the son of the maid servant shall not inherit with the son of the free woman. @ Samơ̆ hơgĕt Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp laĭ? “Puh pơđuaĭ bĕ đah kơmơi hlŭn hăng ană đah rơkơi ñu; yua kơ ană đah rơkơi đah kơmơi hlŭn ƀu dưi mă tŭ kong ngăn hrŏm hăng ană đah rơkơi đah kơmơi rơngai ôh.”

for a husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ [is] head of the assembly. *He* [is] Saviour of the body. @ Yua kơ rơkơi jing akŏ kơ bơnai, kar hăng Yang Krist jing akŏ kơ Phung Sang Ơi Adai. Phung Sang Ơi Adai jing drơi jan Ñu, laih anŭn Ñu jing Pô pơklaih kơ Phung Sang Ơi Adai.

Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it, @  Ơ ƀing jing rơkơi, khăp bĕ kơ bơnai ƀing gih, kar hăng Yang Krist hmâo khăp laih kơ Phung Sang Ơi Adai laih anŭn pơsăn drơi jan Ñu pô yua kơ Phung Sang Ơi Adai,

For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly: @ Yua kơ ƀu hmâo hlơi pô bơrơmŭt kơ drơi jan ñu pô ôh, samơ̆ ñu čem rong laih anŭn khăp kơ gơ̆ kar hăng Yang Krist wai lăng Phung Sang Ơi Adai,

Only conduct yourselves worthily of the glad tidings of the Christ, in order that whether coming and seeing you, or absent, I may hear of what concerns you, that ye stand firm in one spirit, with one soul, labouring together in the same conflict with the faith of the glad tidings; @ Kơnơ̆ng brơi ƀing gih khŏm hơdip năng lăp hăng Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam Yang Krist, kiăng kơ hlăk kâo nao čuă ngui ƀing gih ƀôdah hlăk kâo rơkut, kâo ăt či hmư̆ hing kơ ƀing gih ăt dŏ kơjăp, sa pran jua, sa tơlơi pơmĭn hrŏm hơbĭt pơblah brơi kơ tơlơi đaŏ kơ Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam,

For the rest, then, brethren, we beg you and exhort you in [the] Lord Jesus, even as ye have received from us how ye ought to walk and please God, even as ye also do walk, that ye would abound still more. @ Hnal tuč, Ơ adơi ayŏng, amăng Khua Yang Yêsu, ƀing gơmơi rơkâo kơwưh laih anŭn pơtrŭt pơđur ƀing gih kar hăng ƀing gih hmâo hrăm laih mơ̆ng ƀing gơmơi khŏm hơdip hyư̆m pă kiăng bơmơak kơ Ơi Adai laih anŭn ƀing gih hlăk dŏ hơdip kar hăng anŭn, tui anŭn hơdip bĕ ƀrư̆ hrơi ƀrư̆ hiam hloh dơ̆ng.

“Kâo dŏ pơ anai hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing ană bă Ơi Adai hmâo brơi laih kơ Kâo.”
Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil; @ Yua kơ ƀing ană bă hmâo hrŏm hơbĭt asar đeh laih anŭn drah, yua kơ anŭn mơ̆n Khua Yang Yêsu pô ăt hmâo asar đeh laih anŭn drah kar hăng gơñu, kiăng kơ hăng tơlơi djai Ñu pơrai hĭ pô djă tơlơi dưi kơ tơlơi djai, jing yang sat,

Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people; @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh Ñu khŏm jing kar hăng ƀing adơi ayŏng Ñu amăng djŏp mơta tơlơi, kiăng kơ Ñu dưi jing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh bă hăng pran jua thâo pap drap laih anŭn tŏng ten amăng tơlơi mă bruă kơ Ơi Adai, kiăng kơ dưi song mă tơlơi soh ƀing ană plei pla.

And Moses indeed [was] faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after; @ Môis hmâo tŏng ten amăng abih bang sang Ơi Adai kar hăng sa čô ding kơna, kiăng ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ tơlơi arăng či pơhaih tơdơi.

See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from [the] living God. @ Ơ adơi ayŏng, răng bĕ, hwĭ dah amăng ƀing gih hmâo pran jua sat laih anŭn ƀu đaŏ, wir lui hĭ Ơi Adai Pô hơdip. 
But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. @ Samơ̆ rĭm hrơi pơtô pơđur tơdruă ƀing gih bĕ tơdang ăt dŏ laĭ “Hrơi anai”, kiăng kơ ƀu hmâo hlơi ôh amăng ƀing gih khăng pran jua yua kơ tơlơi soh plư. 
For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end; @ Yua kơ tơdah ƀing ta djă kơjăp tơlơi đaŏ kơnang ƀing ta mơ̆ng blŭng hlâo tơl đŭt, ƀing ta dưi hmâo črăn hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Yang Krist. 
in that it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation; @ Tui hăng Hră Ơi Adai Pơhiăp laĭ:
“Hrơi anai, tơdah ih hmư̆ asăp Ñu,

(for who was it, who, having heard, provoked? but [was it] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses? @  Hlơi jing ƀing hmư̆ asăp Ñu samơ̆ ăt dŏ pơkơdơ̆ng? Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă abih bang ƀing mơnuih Môis hmâo atăt tơbiă laih mơ̆ng čar Êjip?

And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who had not hearkened to the word? @ Laih anŭn kơ hlơi ƀing Ñu ƀuăn rơ̆ng ƀu brơi mŭt pơdơi hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu ôh? Ƀu djơ̆ ôh hă kơ ƀing ƀu gưt hiăp Ñu?

Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed [of it]. @ Tui anŭn, tơdang tơlơi ƀuăn kơ tơlơi mŭt amăng tơlơi pơdơi Ñu ăt dŏ, brơi ƀing ta thâo hwĭ bĕ kiăng kơ ƀu hmâo sa čô hlơi amăng ƀing ta ƀu tơl ôh hơnơ̆ng pơkă. 
For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit *them*, not being mixed with faith in those who heard. @ Yua kơ Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam truh laih kơ ƀing ta kar hăng hmâo truh laih kơ ƀing gơñu; samơ̆ tơlơi pơtô gơñu hmâo hmư̆ anŭn ƀu tŭ yua kơ ƀing gơñu ôh, yua kơ tơdang ƀing gơñu hmư̆, gơñu ƀu mă tŭ ôh tơlơi anŭn hăng tơlơi đaŏ. 
For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from [the] foundation of [the] world. @ Bơ kơ ƀing ta đaŏ laih mŭt laih amăng tơlơi pơdơi anŭn, kar hăng Ñu hmâo laĭ:

Wơ̆t dah bruă Ñu hmâo pơgiơ̆ng laih čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng rơnŭk hrih lŏn tơnah. 
For he has said somewhere of the seventh [day] thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works: @ Yua kơ hmâo anih Ñu hmâo pơhiăp djơ̆ kơ hrơi tal tơjuh tui anai:
“Hrơi tal tơjuh, Ơi Adai pơdơi mơ̆ng abih bang bruă Ñu hmâo ngă laih.”
and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest. @  Laih anŭn Ñu hmâo pơhiăp dơ̆ng amăng anih pơkŏn:
“Gơñu ƀu či mŭt ôh amăng tơlơi Kâo pơdơi.”
Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word, @ Tui anŭn, ăt dŏ hmâo đơđa mơnuih či dưi mŭt amăng tơlơi pơdơi anŭn, laih anŭn ƀing mơnuih hlâo adih hmâo hmư̆ laih Tơlơi Phrâo Hiam samơ̆ ƀu dưi mŭt ôh yua kơ tơlơi ƀing gơñu ƀu gưt hiăp, 
again he determines a certain day, saying, in David, 'To-day,' after so long a time; (according as it has been said before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. @ Ơi Adai pơkơčah sa hrơi dơ̆ng arăng iâu: “Hrơi anai,” tơdang Ñu pơhiăp mơ̆ng amăng bah Đawit sui thŭn tơdơi, kar hăng tơlơi čih laih hlâo adih:
“Hrơi anai, tơdah ƀing gih hmư̆ asăp Ñu,

For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day. @  Yua kơ tơdah Yôsuê brơi laih gơñu pơdơi, Ơi Adai ƀu pơhiăp kơ sa hrơi pơkŏn dơ̆ng ôh. 
There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God. @ Tui anŭn ăt dŏ hmâo sa hrơi pơdơi saƀat brơi kơ ƀing ană plei pla Ơi Adai. 
For he that has entered into his rest, he also has rested from his works, as God did from his own. @ Yua kơ hlơi pô mŭt amăng tơlơi Ơi Adai pơdơi, ñu ăt pơdơi mơ̆n mơ̆ng bruă ñu, kar hăng Ơi Adai pơdơi laih mơ̆ng bruă Ñu. 
Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word. @ Hnŭn yơh, brơi ƀing ta gir hăng abih pran jua mŭt amăng tơlơi pơdơi anŭn, kiăng kơ ƀu hmâo sa čô hlơi amăng ƀing ta lĕ rơbuh yua kơ hla tui hnal pơhmô kơ ƀing ƀu gưt hiăp.
For the word of God [is] living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to [the] division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of [the] heart. @ Sĭt biă mă boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai jing boh pơhiăp hơdip laih anŭn mơyang, ƀơ̆ng hloh kơ sa ƀĕ đao dua bơnah mơta, tơma tơl blah pha jua pơmĭn hăng bơngăt, klang pơtơkuh hăng glo, kơsem khul tơlơi pơmĭn laih anŭn tơlơi pran jua kiăng. 
And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things [are] naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do. @ Laih anŭn ƀơi anăp Ñu ƀu hmâo sa mơta mơnơ̆ng hmâo hrih laih dưi dŏ hơgơ̆m ôh, samơ̆ abih bang mơnơ̆ng pŏk laih anŭn pơrơđah ƀơi anăp mơta Pô ƀing ta khŏm ruai pơdah.
Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession. @ Tui anŭn, yua kơ ƀing ta hmâo sa čô khua ngă yang prŏng hloh hmâo găn laih abih tal adai jing Yêsu, Ană Ơi Adai, brơi ƀing ta djă kơjăp bĕ tơlơi đaŏ ƀing ta pơhaih. 
For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart. @ Yua kơ ƀing ta ƀu hmâo ôh sa čô khua ngă yang prŏng ƀu thâo pap mơñai tơlơi tơdu ƀing ta, samơ̆ hmâo sa čô khua ngă yang prŏng hloh bưp djŏp mơta tơlơi plư kar hăng ƀing ta, samơ̆ Ñu ƀu ngă soh ôh. 
Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help. @ Tui anŭn brơi ƀing ta kơjăp pran jua bĕ nao jĕ gre pơtao tơlơi pap, kiăng kơ ƀing ta dưi tŭ mă tơlơi pap drap laih anŭn hơduah ƀuh tơlơi pap djru kơ ƀing ta djơ̆ mông tơdang ƀing ta hmâo tơlơi kơƀah.
For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins; @ Rĭm čô khua ngă yang prŏng hloh hmâo tơlơi ruah laih mơ̆ng tơ̆ng krah ană mơnuih laih anŭn pơdŏ bruă pơala brơi ană mơnuih ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai, kiăng kơ pơyơr mơnơ̆ng brơi laih anŭn mơnơ̆ng ngă yang yua kơ tơlơi soh. 
being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity; @ Ñu thâo pap kơ ƀing mlŭk laih anŭn kơ ƀing jrok jơlan, yua kơ ñu pô ăt dŏ amăng tơlơi tơdu wang dar kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins. @ Kơlih yua tơlơi anŭn, ñu khŏm pơyơr mơnơ̆ng ngă yang yua kơ tơlơi soh ñu pô, laih anŭn yua kơ tơlơi soh ƀing ană plei pla mơ̆n. 
And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also. @ Ƀu hmâo hlơi ruah mă kơ ñu pô ôh bruă pơpŭ anŭn, samơ̆ khŏm hmâo tơlơi Ơi Adai iâu, kar hăng Arôn.
Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, *Thou* art my Son, *I* have to-day begotten thee. @  Kar kaĭ mơ̆n, Yang Krist ƀu pơpŭ pơđĭ Ñu pô jing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh ôh, samơ̆ mơ̆ng Pô hmâo laĭ kơ Ñu tui anai:

Even as also in another [place] he says, *Thou* [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec. @  Amăng sa anih pơkŏn, Ñu ăt laĭ mơ̆n:

Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us go on [to what belongs] to full growth, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and faith in God, @ Hnŭn yơh, brơi ƀing ta lui hĭ khul mơta tơlơi hrăm amuñ đêl kơ Krist, kơtưn nao bĕ kơ tơlơi klă tum, anăm wơ̆t glaĭ kơ khul tơlơi phŭn atur dơ̆ng ôh, kar hăng: tơlơi kơhmal kơ khul bruă djai, tơlơi đaŏ kơ Ơi Adai,

For ground which drinks the rain which comes often upon it, and produces useful herbs for those for whose sakes also it is tilled, partakes of blessing from God; @ Yua kơ anih lŏn pă ia hơjan hram pơsah ngă brơi añăm tăm čăt đĭ, hmâo tơlơi tŭ yua kơ pô čoh pla, lŏn anŭn mă tŭ tơlơi mơyun hiam mơ̆ng Ơi Adai.

and thus, having had long patience, he got the promise. @ Abraham hmâo gir dŏ tơguan, tui anŭn ñu mă tŭ tơlơi ƀuăn mơ̆ng Ơi Adai. 
For men indeed swear by a greater, and with them the oath is a term to all dispute, as making matters sure. @ Sĭt biă mă, arăng juăt ƀuăn rơ̆ng hăng anăn pô prŏng hloh kơ gơñu pô, laih anŭn abih bang tơlơi pơrơjah dưi pơđŭt hĭ hăng sa tơlơi ƀuăn rơ̆ng kiăng pơsĭt brơi.

For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him; @  Mêlkisadek anai jing pơtao plei Salem, khua ngă yang kơ Ơi Adai Pô Glông Hloh, hmâo nao čơkă hăng hơơč tơlơi mơyun hiam kơ Abraham tơdang ñu wơ̆t glaĭ mơ̆ng tơlơi pơblah dưi hăng ƀing pơtao, 
to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace; @ Abraham hmâo mă sa črăn amăng pluh mơ̆ng abih bang dram gơnam ñu hmâo laih anŭn pơyơr kơ pơtao. Anăn pơtao anŭn, blŭng hlâo kiăng pơblang jing “pơtao tơpă hơnơ̆ng”, laih anŭn ăt jing pơtao kơ Salem, kiăng laĭ “pơtao rơnŭk rơnua”. 
without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually. @ Ñu ƀu hmâo ama, ƀu hmâo amĭ, ƀu hmâo djuai hrĕ, ƀu hmâo hrơi tơkeng, kŏn hmâo hrơi djai lơi, samơ̆ kar hăng Ană Ơi Adai, jing khua ngă yang hlŏng lar.
Now consider how great this [personage] was, to whom [even] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils. @ Pơmĭn lăng bĕ pơtao anŭn prŏng dơ̆ pă! Wơ̆t kơ Abraham jing ơi adon phŭn, ăt khŏm mă sa črăn amăng pluh dram gơnam ñu sua mă amăng tơlơi pơblah pơyơr kơ ñu. 
And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham: @ Hmâo sa tơlơi pơtă amăng tơlơi juăt ƀing ană tơčo Lêwi jing ƀing khua ngă yang dưi mă sa črăn amăng pluh mơ̆ng ƀing ană plei pla, kiăng laĭ mơ̆ng ƀing adơi ayŏng gơñu pô, wơ̆t dah ƀing anŭn leng kơ jing ană tơčo Abraham soh sel. 
but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises. @ Samơ̆ Mêlkisadek anai, ƀu tơbiă rai mơ̆ng kơnŭng djuai Lêwi ôh, ăt mă tŭ sa črăn amăng pluh mơ̆ng Abraham laih anŭn hơơč tơlơi mơyun hiam kơ ñu jing pô hmâo tơlơi Ơi Adai ƀuăn. 
But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better. @ Arăng ƀu dưi pơrơjah ôh kơ tơlơi anai, pô prŏng hloh hơơč mơyun hiam kơ pô anĕt hloh. 
And here dying men receive tithes; but there [one] of whom the witness is that he lives; @ Amăng tơlơi anai, ƀing mơnuih mă tŭ sa črăn amăng pluh jing ƀing mơnuih thâo djai; amăng tơlơi pơkŏn, mơnuih anŭn Ơi Adai gơ̆ng jơlan pơsĭt jing mơnuih hlăk dŏ hơdip. 
and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes. @ Arăng dưi laĭ kơ Lêwi, jing pô mă tŭ sa črăn amăng pluh, hmâo pơyơr laih sa črăn amăng pluh găn mơ̆ng Abraham, 
For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him. @ yua kơ hlăk Mêlkisadek nao čơkă Abraham, Lêwi ăt dŏ amăng hơtai pruăi Abraham.
If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with *it*, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron? @ Tơdah bruă khua ngă yang Lêwi dưi tơl tơlơi klă tum (yua kơ ƀing ană plei pla mă tŭ laih tơlơi juăt gah yŭ kơ bruă ngă yang anai) hơgĕt yom kiăng hmâo sa čô khua ngă yang pơkŏn dơ̆ng tơbiă rai tui hăng tơpul Mêlkisadek, ƀu djơ̆ tui hăng tơpul Arôn ôh? 
For, the priesthood being changed, there takes place of necessity a change of law also. @ Bruă khua ngă yang hmâo tơlơi pơplih laih, hnŭn yơh tơlơi juăt ăt khŏm pơplih mơ̆n. 
For he, of whom these things are said, belongs to a different tribe, of which no one has [ever] been attached to the service of the altar. @ Bơ kơ Pô hơdôm boh pơhiăp anŭn hmâo laĭ nao jing lơ̆m kơ sa kơnŭng djuai pơkŏn, laih anŭn amăng kơnŭng djuai anŭn aka hmâo hlơi ôh buih bruă ƀơi kơƀang ngă yang. 
For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests. @ Yua kơ sĭt biă mă Khua Yang ƀing ta tơbiă rai mơ̆ng kơnŭng djuai Yuđa, jing kơnŭng djuai Môis ƀu hmâo pơhiăp djơ̆ ôh kơ bruă khua ngă yang.
And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec, @ Tơlơi anai jai klă rơđah hloh dơ̆ng, tơ hmâo khua ngă yang pơkŏn tơbiă rai kar hăng Mêlkisadek, 
who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life. @ jing khua ngă yang ƀu djơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi juăt kơ tơlơi phiăn ană mơnuih ôh, samơ̆ tui hăng tơlơi dưi mơyang kơ tơlơi hơdip ƀu thâo răm rai. 
For it is borne witness, *Thou* art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec. @ Yua kơ hmâo boh pơhiăp ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ Ñu tui anai:
“Ih jing khua ngă yang hlŏng lar,

For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness, @ Tui anŭn, sa bơnah tơlơi juăt so arăng lui hĭ laih ñu yua kơ ñu tơdu laih anŭn ƀu tŭ yua ôh 
(for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God. @ (yua kơ tơlơi juăt ƀu dưi ngă brơi tơlơi hơgĕt jing klă tum ôh); bơnah pơkŏn, hmâo sa tơlơi čang rơmang hiam hloh hmâo pha brơi, kiăng kơ mơ̆ng tơlơi anŭn ƀing ta nao giăm Ơi Adai.
And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath; @ Bruă anai hmâo pơjing laih hăng sa tơlơi ƀuăn rơ̆ng. Ƀing khua ngă yang pơkŏn hmâo pơjing đĭ samơ̆ ƀu hmâo tơlơi ƀuăn rơ̆ng ôh; 
(for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], *Thou* [art] priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];) @ samơ̆ Khua Yang Yêsu jing hĭ khua ngă yang hăng tơlơi ƀuăn rơ̆ng, yua kơ Ơi Adai hmâo laĭ kơ Ñu tui anai:
“Khua Yang hmâo ƀuăn rơ̆ng laih, laih anŭn Ñu ƀu či pơplih ôh,

by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh, Khua Yang Yêsu hmâo jing hĭ laih Pô grơ̆ng kơjăp brơi sa kơnol pơgop hiam hloh.
And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death; @ Đưm hlâo adih mrô ƀing khua ngă yang jing lu, yua kơ gơñu khŏm djai ƀu dưi ngă nanao bruă mă anŭn ôh. 
but he, because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable. @ Samơ̆ Khua Yang Yêsu djă bruă khua ngă yang nanao, yua kơ Ñu dŏ hơdip hlŏng lar. 
Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them. @ Yua kơ anŭn, Ñu dưi pơklaih tum num ƀing mơnuih kơnang kơ Ñu kiăng nao giăm Ơi Adai, yua kơ Ñu hơdip hlŏng lar kiăng iâu laĭ pơala brơi kơ ƀing mơnuih anŭn.
For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens: @ Sĭt yơh, Ñu jing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh Pô ƀing ta kiăng biă mă: rơgoh hơčih, ƀu hmâo tơlơi soh, ƀu hmâo tơlơi hơƀak drak, pơčơlah hĭ mơ̆ng ƀing mơnuih soh, hmâo tơlơi pơpŭ glong hloh kơ khul tal adai. 
who has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then [for] those of the people; for this he did once for all [in] having offered up himself. @ Ƀu hrup hăng ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh pơkŏn ôh, Ñu ƀu khŏm pơyơr mơnơ̆ng ngă yang rĭm hrơi, blŭng hlâo yua kơ tơlơi soh ñu pô, tơdơi yua kơ tơlơi soh ană plei pla. Ñu pơyơr Ñu pô jing mơnơ̆ng ngă yang sa wơ̆t djŏp laih. 
For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [is] after the law, a Son perfected for ever. @ Yua kơ tơlơi juăt pơjing ƀing mơnuih tơdu hơđăp amơĭ ngă khua ngă yang prŏng hloh; bơ kơ tơlơi ƀuăn rơ̆ng hmâo tơdơi kơ tơlơi juăt, pơdơ̆ng pioh Ană, jing Pô hmâo tơlơi klă tum hlŏng lar.
Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking [is], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens; @  Tơlơi phŭn kơnel ƀing ta dŏ pơhiăp jing: Ƀing ta hmâo sa čô khua ngă yang prŏng hloh, Pô dŏ ber gah hơnuă gre pơtao Pô Guh Kơang amăng adai. 
minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man. @ Ñu jing pô buih bruă amăng anih rơgoh hiam, jing amăng sang khăn sĭt, Khua Yang Pô pơdơ̆ng laih ƀu djơ̆ mơnuih ôh. 
For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer. @ Yua kơ abih bang ƀing khua ngă yang prŏng hloh arăng hmâo pơdưm brơi kiăng kơ pơyơr mơnơ̆ng brơi laih anŭn mơnơ̆ng ngă yang; yua kơ anŭn, khua ngă yang prŏng anai khŏm hmâo mơnơ̆ng pơyơr kar kaĭ mơ̆n. 
If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law, @ Tơdah Ñu ăt dŏ ƀơi lŏn tơnah, Ñu ƀu jing khua ngă yang ôh, yua kơ ƀơi lŏn tơnah anai hmâo laih ƀing khua ngă yang pơyơr mơnơ̆ng brơi tui hăng tơlơi juăt. 
(who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told [when] about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.) @ Tơlơi buih bruă gơñu amăng anih rơgoh hiam, jing rup hruă tui laih anŭn pô̆ kơ anih rơgoh hiam amăng adai; yua kơ tơdang Môis čơdơ̆ng pơdơ̆ng sang khăn, Ơi Adai pơtă kơ ñu tui anai: “Răng bĕ, brơi ih ngă abih bang tui hăng rup Kâo hmâo bơrơđah brơi laih kơ ih ƀơi ngŏ čư̆.” 
But now he has got a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant, which is established on the footing of better promises. @ Samơ̆ ră anai Yêsu hmâo mă tŭ laih bruă mă prŏng hloh, yua kơ Ñu jing Pô Dŏ Kơplah kơ kơnol pơgop hiam hloh, yua kơ kơnol pơgop anŭn hmâo pơdơ̆ng ƀơi tơlơi ƀuăn hiam hloh.

For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda; @ Samơ̆ Ơi Adai ƀuh tơlơi soh glaĭ amăng ƀing ană plei pla, tơdang Ñu laĭ:

Because this [is] the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and *they* shall be to me for people. @ Khua Yang laĭ dơ̆ng: “Anai jing kơnol pơgop Kâo či pơjing hăng sang Israel:

having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant, covered round in every part with gold, in which [were] the golden pot that had the manna, and the rod of Aaron that had sprouted, and the tables of the covenant; @ Hmâo kơnưl pơyơr mơnơ̆ng ƀâu mơngưi ngă hăng mah laih anŭn hip kơnol pơgop lom hăng mah soh sel.

the Holy Spirit shewing this, that the way of the [holy of] holies has not yet been made manifest while as yet the first tabernacle has [its] standing; @ Yang Bơngăt Hiam yua tơlơi anai kiăng pơrơđah brơi tơdang sang khăn tal sa ăt dŏ, jơlan mŭt amăng Anih Rơgoh Hiam Hloh aka pŏk ôh.

nor by blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, has entered in once for all into the [holy of] holies, having found an eternal redemption. @ Ñu mŭt laih amăng Anih Rơgoh Hiam Hloh sa wơ̆t djŏp laih, ƀu yua drah bơbe tơno laih anŭn drah ană rơmo, samơ̆ yua drah Ñu pô, kiăng ba rai tơlơi song mă hlŏng lar kơ ƀing ta. 
For if the blood of goats and bulls, and a heifer's ashes sprinkling the defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh, @ Yua kơ tơdah tơlơi arăng prăh drah bơbe tơno laih anŭn rơmo tơno laih anŭn hơbâo rơmo dra ƀơi mơnuih hơƀak drak laih, ăt dưi pơrơgoh mơ̆n gơñu kiăng kơ gơñu dưi rơgoh gah kơ asar đeh, 
how much rather shall the blood of the Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself spotless to God, purify your conscience from dead works to worship [the] living God? @ hloh kơ anŭn dơ̆ng drah Yang Krist, jing Pô kơnang mơ̆ng Yang Bơngăt Hiam hlŏng lar, pơyơr Ñu pô kơ Ơi Adai kar hăng mơnơ̆ng pơyơr ƀu hmâo rơka, dưi pơrơgoh pran jua tơpă ƀing gih mơ̆ng bruă mơnuă djai, kiăng kơ ƀing gih buih bruă kơ Ơi Adai hơdip.
And for this reason he is mediator of a new covenant, so that, death having taken place for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance. @ Yua kơ tơlơi anŭn yơh, Yang Krist jing Pô Dŏ Kơplah kơ kơnol pơgop phrâo, yua mơ̆ng anŭn ƀing mơnuih hmâo iâu laih dưi mă tŭ kong ngăn hlŏng lar hmâo ƀuăn brơi laih kơ gơñu, yua kơ tơlơi djai Ñu hmâo tŭ laih, dưi song mă ƀing mơnuih hmâo ngă soh laih gah yŭ kơnol pơgop tal sa.
(For where [there is] a testament, the death of the testator must needs come in. @ Yua kơ pơpă hmâo hră čih pơtă pioh, brơi khŏm pơsĭt pô ngă hră čih pơtă pioh anŭn djai laih. 
For a testament [is] of force when men are dead, since it is in no way of force while the testator is alive.) @ Hră čih pơtă pioh hmâo tơlơi tŭ yua kơnơ̆ng tơdơi kơ tơlơi djai đôč, yua kơ tơdah pô ngă hră čih pơtă pioh ăt dŏ hơdip ñu ƀu hmâo tơlơi tŭ yua hơgĕt ôh. 
Whence neither the first was inaugurated without blood. @ Tui anŭn wơ̆t kơnol pơgop tal sa ăt ƀu hmâo tơlơi tŭ yua ôh tơdah ƀu hmâo drah. 
For every commandment having been spoken according to [the] law by Moses to all the people; having taken the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, @ Yua kơ tơdang Môis pơhaih abih bang tơlơi pơtă amăng tơlơi juăt kơ abih bang ƀing ană plei pla, ñu mă drah ană rơmo, bơbe tơno hơbĭt hăng ia, blâu triu mriah laih anŭn hla hisôp ñu prăh ƀơi hơdrôm hră wơ̆t ƀơi abih bang ană plei pla, 
saying, This [is] the blood of the covenant which God has enjoined to you. @ laih anŭn laĭ: “Anai jing drah kơnol pơgop Ơi Adai hmâo pơtă laih kơ ƀing gih.” 
And the tabernacle too and all the vessels of service he sprinkled in like manner with blood; @ Ăt kar hăng tui anŭn mơ̆n, ñu prăh drah ƀơi sang khăn wơ̆t ƀơi abih bang gơnam yua pioh kơ bruă kơkuh pơpŭ. 
and almost all things are purified with blood according to the law, and without blood-shedding there is no remission. @ Sĭt biă mă, tui hăng tơlơi juăt abih bang mơnơ̆ng dưi jing hĭ rơgoh yua mơ̆ng drah, laih anŭn ƀu hmâo tơlơi tuh drah, ƀu hmâo tơlơi pap brơi tơlơi soh ôh.
[It was] necessary then that the figurative representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with sacrifices better than these. @ Tui anŭn, tơdah khul rup pơhmô kơ abih mơnơ̆ng amăng adai khŏm kơnang kơ mơnơ̆ng ngă yang anŭn kiăng dưi rơgoh, tui anŭn mơ̆n khul mơnơ̆ng sĭt amăng adai khŏm kơnang kơ mơnơ̆ng ngă yang hiam hloh kiăng dưi rơgoh. 
For the Christ is not entered into holy places made with hand, figures of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear before the face of God for us: @ Yua kơ Yang Krist ƀu mŭt ôh amăng anih rơgoh hiam yua mơ̆ng tơngan ană mơnuih ngă, jing rup kơ anih rơgoh sĭt; samơ̆ mŭt laih amăng plei hiam, laih anŭn kiăng kơ ră anai Ñu pơala kơ ƀing ta nao ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai. 
nor in order that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with blood not his own; @ Ñu ăt ƀu pơyơr Ñu pô lu wơ̆t ôh, kar hăng khua ngă yang prŏng hloh rĭm thŭn ñu mŭt amăng Anih Rơgoh Hiam Hloh pơyơr drah ƀu djơ̆ hăng drah ñu pô ôh. 
since he had [then] been obliged often to suffer from the foundation of the world. But now once in the consummation of the ages he has been manifested for [the] putting away of sin by his sacrifice. @ Yua kơ tơdah tui anŭn, Ñu hmâo tŭ laih tơlơi ruă nuă lu wơ̆t mơ̆ng hrơi čơdơ̆ng phŭn lŏn tơnah.

And forasmuch as it is the portion of men once to die, and after this judgment; @ Tui hăng tơlơi hmâo pơkă laih kơ ană mơnuih khŏm djai sa wơ̆t, giơ̆ng anŭn tŭ tơlơi phat kơđi, 
thus the Christ also, having been once offered to bear the sins of many, shall appear to those that look for him the second time without sin for salvation. @ Ăt kar hăng anŭn mơ̆n, Yang Krist hmâo pơyơr Ñu pô kơnơ̆ng sa wơ̆t đôč kiăng sut lui hĭ tơlơi soh kơ lu mơnuih; laih anŭn Ñu či pơrơđah rai tal dua dơ̆ng, ƀu djơ̆ kiăng mă lui tơlơi soh dơ̆ng ôh, samơ̆ kiăng pơklaih ƀing mơnuih dŏ tơguan Ñu.
For the law, having a shadow of the coming good things, not the image itself of the things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually yearly, perfect those who approach. @ Yua kơ tơlơi juăt kơnơ̆ng jing pô̆ kơ khul tơlơi hiam či truh tơdơi đôč, ƀu djơ̆ jing rup sĭt kơ tơlơi mơnơ̆ng ôh, hnŭn yơh ƀing mơnuih nao jĕ Ơi Adai ƀu dưi jing klă tum ôh yua mơ̆ng khul mơnơ̆ng ngă yang hmâo pơyơr nanao rĭm thŭn. 
Since, would they not indeed have ceased being offered, on account of the worshippers once purged having no longer any conscience of sins? @ Tơdah dưi, gơñu pơdơi laih pơyơr mơnơ̆ng ngă yang, yua kơ ƀing mơnuih kơkuh pơpŭ dưi hmâo pơrơgoh sa wơ̆t djŏp laih, tui anŭn gơñu ƀu či mưn tơlơi soh dơ̆ng tah. 
But in these [there is] a calling to mind of sins yearly. @ Samơ̆ khul mơnơ̆ng ngă yang anŭn kơnơ̆ng kiăng pơhơdơr kơ tơlơi soh rĭm thŭn đôč. 
For blood of bulls and goats [is] incapable of taking away sins. @ Yua kơ drah khul rơmo tơno laih anŭn bơbe tơno ƀu dưi mă lui tơlơi soh ôh.
Wherefore coming into the world he says, Sacrifice and offering thou willedst not; but thou hast prepared me a body. @  Yua kơ hnŭn yơh, tơ Yang Krist mŭt laih amăng lŏn tơnah, Ñu laĭ:
“Ih ƀu kiăng ôh mơnơ̆ng ngă yang, ăt kŏn kiăng lơi mơnơ̆ng pơyơr,

Thou tookest no pleasure in burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin. @ Ih ƀu mơak ôh kơ mơnơ̆ng ngă yang čuh

Then I said, Lo, I come (in [the] roll of the book it is written of me) to do, O God, thy will. @ Hnŭn yơh, Kâo laĭ: ‘Ơ Ơi Adai, anai nê Kâo rai laih,
Kiăng ngă tơlơi Ih kiăng,’
Amăng hră hmâo čih laih kơ Kâo.”
Above, saying Sacrifices and offerings and burnt-offerings and sacrifices for sin thou willedst not, neither tookest pleasure in (which are offered according to the law); @ Hlâo anŭn Ñu hmâo laĭ: “Ih ƀu kiăng ôh, kŏn mơak lơi kơ mơnơ̆ng ngă yang, mơnơ̆ng pơyơr, mơnơ̆ng ngă yang čuh laih anŭn mơnơ̆ng ngă yang song mă tơlơi soh” (arăng pơyơr mơnơ̆ng anŭn tui hăng tơlơi juăt), 
then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will. He takes away the first that he may establish the second; @ laih anŭn Ñu laĭ dơ̆ng: “Anai nê, Kâo rai kiăng ngă tui tơlơi Ih kiăng.” Tui anŭn Ñu lui hĭ laih tơlơi ngă yang tal hlâo kiăng pơjing tơlơi ngă yang tal dua. 
by which will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. @ Tui hăng tơlơi Ơi Adai kiăng, ƀing ta dưi hmâo tơlơi rơgoh hiam yua mơ̆ng Yang Yêsu Krist hmâo pơyơr laih drơi jan Ñu pô sa wơ̆t djŏp laih.
And every priest stands daily ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. @  Laih anŭn rĭm čô khua ngă yang rĭm hrơi dŏ dơ̆ng buih bruă nanao pơyơr sa mơta mơnơ̆ng ngă yang kar kaĭ, mơnơ̆ng ngă yang anŭn ƀu dưi mă lui tơlơi soh ôh. 
But *he*, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down in perpetuity at [the] right hand of God, @ Samơ̆ Yang Krist hmâo pơyơr laih sa mơnơ̆ng ngă yang kơnơ̆ng hasa yua kơ tơlơi soh kơ abih bang rơnŭk, giơ̆ng anŭn Ñu dŏ ber gah hơnuă kơ Ơi Adai,

For by one offering he has perfected in perpetuity the sanctified. @ Yua kơ mơ̆ng sa mơnơ̆ng ngă yang kơnơ̆ng hasa, Ñu pơjing brơi ƀing mơnuih hmâo pơrơgoh laih jing hĭ klă tum nanao.
And the Holy Spirit also bears us witness [of it]; for after what was said: @ Laih anŭn Yang Bơngăt Hiam ăt ngă gơ̆ng jơlan brơi ƀing ta, yua kơ giơ̆ng Ñu pơhiăp:
This [is] the covenant which I will establish towards them after those days, saith [the] Lord: Giving my laws into their hearts, I will write them also in their understandings; @  Khua Yang laĭ: “Anai jing kơnol pơgop Kâo či pơjing hăng gơñu:

and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more. @ Ñu laĭ dơ̆ng:
“Kâo ƀu či hơdơr dơ̆ng ôh kơ tơlơi soh laih anŭn tơlơi sat ƀai gơñu.”
But where there [is] remission of these, [there is] no longer a sacrifice for sin. @ Anih pă hmâo laih tơlơi pap brơi tơlơi soh, anih anŭn ƀu kiăng pơyơr mơnơ̆ng ngă yang yua kơ tơlơi soh dơ̆ng tah.
Having therefore, brethren, boldness for entering into the [holy of] holies by the blood of Jesus, @ Tui anŭn, Ơ adơi ayŏng, ƀing ta hmâo tơlơi khĭn dưi mŭt amăng Anih Rơgoh Hiam Hloh yua mơ̆ng drah Yêsu,

Ye endure for chastening, God conducts himself towards you as towards sons; for who is the son that the father chastens not? @ Ƀing gih tŭ mă tơlơi phak pơkra, anŭn jing tơlơi Ơi Adai ngă kơ ƀing gih kar hăng sa čô ană; yua kơ hmâo mơ̆ hlơi jing ană samơ̆ ama ñu ƀu phak pơkra kơ ñu ôh?

Moreover we have had the fathers of our flesh as chasteners, and we reverenced [them]; shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live? @ Hloh kơ anŭn dơ̆ng, ama gah kơ asar đeh phak pơkra kơ ƀing ta, ƀing ta ăt hwĭ pơpŭ kơ gơñu mơ̆n, ƀai jai Ama gah kơ bơngăt, ƀing ta ƀu či tui gưt lu hloh dơ̆ng ôh hă kiăng kơ dưi hmâo tơlơi hơdip? 
For they indeed chastened for a few days, as seemed good to them; but he for profit, in order to the partaking of his holiness. @ Yua kơ ama gah asar đeh phak pơkra ƀing ta kơnơ̆ng ƀiă hrơi đôč tui hăng tơlơi gơñu pơmĭn jing hiam, samơ̆ Ơi Adai phak pơkra kơ ƀing jing yua kơ tơlơi tŭ yua brơi kơ ƀing ta, kiăng kơ ƀing ta dưi hmâo hrŏm hơbĭt amăng tơlơi rơgoh hiam Ñu.

This, a second letter, beloved, I already write to you, in [both] which I stir up, in the way of putting you in remembrance, your pure mind, @ Ơ ƀing kâo khăp hơeng, anai jing hră mơit tal dua kâo čih kơ ƀing gih.

and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for from the time the fathers fell asleep all things remain thus from [the] beginning of [the] creation. @ Gơñu či laĭ: “Pơpă lĕ tơlơi ƀuăn kơ tơlơi Ñu rai dơ̆ng?

For this is hidden from them through their own wilfulness, that heavens were of old, and an earth, having its subsistence out of water and in water, by the word of God, @ Gơñu prơ̆ng kiăng wơr bĭt tơlơi sĭt anai: mơ̆ng sui laih Ơi Adai hmâo pơjing adai laih anŭn lŏn tơnah hăng boh pơhiăp Ñu Pô, lŏn tơnah hmâo tơbiă rai mơ̆ng ia laih anŭn yua mơ̆ng ia. 
through which [waters] the then world, deluged with water, perished. @ Laih anŭn ăt yua mơ̆ng ia mơ̆n, lŏn tơnah rơnŭk anŭn ia lip hĭ laih anŭn răm rai. 
But the present heavens and the earth by his word are laid up in store, kept for fire unto a day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men. @ Samơ̆ hăng boh pơhiăp anŭn mơ̆n khul adai laih anŭn lŏn tơnah ră anai Ơi Adai hmâo pioh brơi laih kơ apui, laih anŭn djă pioh tơl truh hrơi phat kơđi laih anŭn pơrai ƀing ƀu hwĭ pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai.
But let not this one thing be hidden from you, beloved, that one day with [the] Lord [is] as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. @  Samơ̆ ơ ƀing kâo khăp hơeng, anăm wơr bĭt ôh tơlơi anai, ƀơi anăp Khua Yang sa hrơi jing kar hăng sa rơbâo thŭn, laih anŭn sa rơbâo thŭn jing kar hăng sa hrơi. 
[The] Lord does not delay his promise, as some account of delay, but is longsuffering towards you, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. @ Khua Yang ƀu kaih ôh pơsĭt tơlơi Ñu ƀuăn kar hăng đơđa mơnuih pơmĭn, samơ̆ Ñu dŏ gir hăng ƀing gih, ƀu kiăng sa čô hlơi či răm rơngiă ôh, samơ̆ kiăng kơ abih bang leng kơ kơhmal tơlơi soh. 
But the day of [the] Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a rushing noise, and [the] elements, burning with heat, shall be dissolved, and [the] earth and the works in it shall be burnt up. @ Samơ̆ hrơi Khua Yang či rai kar hăng sa čô mơnuih klĕ, hlăk anŭn khul adai či rơngiă hĭ thĕng hăng dơnai kơtang, khul mơnơ̆ng amăng adai či lik hĭ amăng apui, lŏn tơnah wơ̆t abih bruă arăng ngă amăng anŭn apui či ƀơ̆ng abih.

*Ye* therefore, beloved, knowing [these] things before, take care lest, being led away along with the error of the wicked, ye should fall from your own stedfastness: @ Ơ ƀing kâo khăp hơeng, yua kơ ƀing gih thâo hlâo laih tơlơi anŭn; tui anŭn, răng bĕ hwĭ dah ƀing soh sat či ba pơđuaĭ ƀing gih hăng tơlơi jrok jơlan gơñu, laih anŭn ƀing gih rơngiă tơlơi kơjăp ƀing gih.

The old commandment is the word which ye heard. @  Ơ ƀing kâo khăp hơeng, kâo ƀu čih kơ ƀing gih tơlơi pơtă phrâo ôh, samơ̆ tơlơi pơtă hơđăp ƀing gih hmâo laih mơ̆ng phŭn blŭng.

and before the throne, as a glass sea, like crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, four living creatures, full of eyes, before and behind; @ Ƀơi anăp gre pơtao hmâo mơnơ̆ng lăng kar hăng ia rơsĭ mơnĭl, jơngeh kar hăng boh pơtâo bơngač; tơ̆ng krah laih anŭn jum dar gre pơtao hmâo pă drơi mơnơ̆ng hơdip, bă hăng mơta ƀơi anăp laih anŭn gah klon. 
and the first living creature like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature having the face as of a man, and the fourth living creature like a flying eagle. @ Mơnơ̆ng hơdip tal sa kar hăng rơmông dŭl, mơnơ̆ng hơdip tal dua kar hăng rơmo tơno, mơnơ̆ng hơdip tal klâo hmâo ƀô̆ mơta kar hăng ƀô̆ mơta mơnuih, laih anŭn mơnơ̆ng hơdip tal pă kar hăng čĭm klang dŏ pơr. 
And the four living creatures, each one of them having respectively six wings; round and within they are full of eyes; and they cease not day and night saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, who was, and who is, and who is to come. @ Pă mơnơ̆ng hơdip anŭn, rĭm drơi hmâo năm pŏk čăng, jum dar laih anŭn amăng lăm ñu bă hăng khul mơta; hrơi mlam gơñu adoh ƀu pơdơi ôh:

And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanksgiving to him that sits upon the throne, who lives to the ages of ages, @ Rĭm wơ̆t khul hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip pơyơr tơlơi guh kơang, tơlơi pơpŭ laih anŭn tơlơi bơni hơơč kơ Pô dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao, Pô hơdip hlŏng lar, 
the twenty-four elders shall fall before him that sits upon the throne, and do homage to him that lives to the ages of ages; and shall cast their crowns before the throne, saying, @ dua pluh pă čô ƀing kŏng tha bon kŭp ƀơi anăp Pô dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao, laih anŭn kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Pô dŏ hơdip hlŏng lar.

And I saw on the right hand of him that sat upon the throne a book, written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals. @  Giơ̆ng tơlơi anŭn kâo ƀuh amăng tơngan hơnuă Pô dŏ ƀơi gre pơtao sa čơkul hră klĭ hmâo čih laih amăng lăm wơ̆t gah rơngiao, arăng hmâo kơđơ̆l laih hăng tơjuh mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm.

And no one was able in the heaven, or upon the earth, or underneath the earth, to open the book, or to regard it. @ Samơ̆ amăng adai adih, ƀơi lŏn tơnah, ƀôdah gah yŭ lŏn tơnah ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi pŏk čơkul hră anŭn ƀôdah dưi lăng ñu.

And one of the elders says to me, Do not weep. Behold, the lion which [is] of the tribe of Juda, the root of David, has overcome [so as] to open the book, and its seven seals. @ Laih anŭn hmâo sa čô amăng ƀing kŏng tha laĭ kơ kâo: “Anăm hia ôh; anai nê, Rơmông Dŭl kơnŭng djuai Yuđa, ană tơčo Đawit dưi laih, Ñu yơh dưi pŏk čơkul hră klĭ anŭn, laih anŭn yaih tơjuh mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm anai.”
And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God [which are] sent into all the earth: @  Kâo ƀuh Ană Triu hrup hăng arăng hmâo pơdjai Ñu laih, hlăk dŏ dơ̆ng tơ̆ng krah gre pơtao, jum dar gre hmâo pă drơi hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip laih anŭn ƀing kŏng tha.

and it came and took [it] out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. @ Ană Triu nao mă čơkul hră klĭ mơ̆ng tơngan hơnuă Pô dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao. 
And when it took the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, having each a harp and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the saints. @ Giơ̆ng Ñu mă čơkul hră klĭ anŭn, pă drơi hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip laih anŭn ƀing dua pluh pă čô kŏng tha bon ƀơi anăp Ană Triu, rĭm čô djă sa boh gong, laih anŭn khul čơlŭ mah bă hăng mơnơ̆ng ƀâu mơngưi, anŭn jing tơlơi iâu laĭ kơ ƀing rơgoh hiam. 
And they sing a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open its seals; because thou hast been slain, and hast redeemed to God, by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, @ Ƀing gơñu adoh sa tơlơi adoh phrâo tui anai:

And I saw, and I heard [the] voice of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and their number was ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands; @  Kâo lăng, laih anŭn hmư̆ asăp lu ling jang jum dar gre pơtao, laih anŭn khul hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ƀing kŏng tha.

saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that has been slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. @ Gơñu adoh hăng asăp kraih:

And every creature which is in the heaven and upon the earth and under the earth, and [those that are] upon the sea, and all things in them, heard I saying, To him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, blessing, and honour, and glory, and might, to the ages of ages. @ Laih anŭn kâo hmư̆ abih bang mơnơ̆ng hrih pơjing amăng adai, ƀơi lŏn tơnah, gah yŭ lŏn tơnah, amăng ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn abih bang mơnơ̆ng amăng khul anih anŭn adoh:

And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as a voice of thunder, Come [and see]. @ Kâo ƀuh tơdang Ană Triu pŏk mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm tal sa amăng tơjuh mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm, laih anŭn kâo hmư̆ sa amăng pă drơi hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip laĭ kraih kar hăng dơnai grơ̆m: “Rai bĕ!” 
And I saw: and behold, a white horse, and he that sat upon it having a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering and that he might conquer. @ Kâo lăng, anai nê hmâo sa drơi aseh kŏ.

And when it opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, Come [and see]. @ Tơdang Ană Triu pŏk mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm tal dua, kâo hmư̆ hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip tal dua laĭ tui anai: “Rai bĕ!” 
And another, a red horse, went forth; and to him that sat upon it, to him it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should slay one another; and there was given to him a great sword. @ Laih anŭn sa drơi aseh pơkŏn, mriah hêm tơbiă rai.

And when it opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, Come [and see]. And I saw: and behold, a black horse, and he that sat upon it having a balance in his hand. @  Tơdang Ană Triu pŏk mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm tal klâo, kâo hmư̆ hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip tal klâo laĭ: “Rai bĕ!” Kâo lăng, anai nê hmâo sa drơi aseh jŭ. Pô đĭ aseh anŭn amăng tơngan ñu djă boh kơnăng. 
And I heard as a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenixes of barley for a denarius: and do not injure the oil and the wine. @ Laih anŭn kâo hmư̆ kar hăng sa asăp tơ̆ng krah pă drơi hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip laĭ: “Sa ƀuat pơdai tơpŭng mơdôm sa đơniê, laih anŭn klâo ƀuat pơdai ôrgơ mơdôm sa đơniê, samơ̆ anăm ngă răm ôh kơ ia ôliwơ laih anŭn ia tơpai!”
And when it opened the fourth seal, I heard [the voice of] the fourth living creature saying, Come [and see]. @ Tơdang Ană Triu pŏk mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm tal pă, kâo hmư̆ asăp hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip tal pă laĭ: “Rai bĕ!” 
And I saw: and behold, a pale horse, and he that sat upon it, his name [was] Death, and hades followed with him; and authority was given to him over the fourth of the earth to slay with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and by the beasts of the earth. @ Kâo lăng, anai nê hmâo sa drơi aseh ƀhul.

And when it opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that had been slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held; @ Tơdang Ană Triu pŏk mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm tal rơma, kâo ƀuh gah yŭ kơƀang ngă yang hmâo bơngăt ƀing arăng pơdjai laih yua kơ boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai laih anŭn yua kơ tơlơi gơñu ngă gơ̆ng jơlan. 
and they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O sovereign Ruler, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell upon the earth? @ Gơñu ur kraih tui anai: “Ơ Khua Yang jing Pô rơgoh hiam laih anŭn sĭt, hơdôm sui dơ̆ng Ih či phat kơđi, laih anŭn rŭ nua kơ ƀing dŏ ƀơi lŏn tơnah yua kơ drah ƀing gơmơi?” 
And there was given to them, to each one a white robe; and it was said to them that they should rest yet a little while, until both their fellow-bondmen and their brethren, who were about to be killed as they, should be fulfilled. @ Arăng brơi kơ rĭm čô gơñu sa blah ao phyung kŏ, laih anŭn arăng pơtă gơñu khŏm pơdơi sui ƀiă dơ̆ng, tơl mrô ƀing mă bruă hrŏm hơbĭt hăng gơñu tum laih, laih anŭn ƀing adơi ayŏng gơñu khŏm tŭ tơlơi djai kar hăng gơñu tŭ laih.
And I saw when it opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as hair sackcloth, and the whole moon became as blood, @  Tơdang Ană Triu pŏk mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm tal năm, kâo ƀuh tơlơi pơpư̆ lŏn tơnah kơtang kơtĭt; yang hrơi jing hĭ kơnăm kar hăng bơnal jŭ, yang blan jing hĭ mriah kar hăng drah, 
and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth, as a fig tree, shaken by a great wind, casts its unseasonable figs. @ khul pơtŭ amăng adai lĕ trŭn ƀơi lŏn tơnah kar hăng khul boh hra mơtah ruh trŭn mơ̆ng phŭn hra hlăk angĭn kơtang. 
And the heaven was removed as a book rolled up, and every mountain and island were removed out of their places. @ Adai rơngiă hĭ kar hăng čơkul hră klĭ lom glaĭ, abih bang khul čư̆, abih bang khul plao ia leng kơ tơglưh đuaĭ mơ̆ng anih gơñu. 
And the kings of the earth, and the great, and the chiliarchs, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains; @ Laih anŭn ƀing pơtao ƀơi lŏn tơnah, ƀing khua prŏng, ƀing khua tơhan, ƀing pơdrŏng, ƀing hmâo tơlơi dưi, abih bang ƀing hlŭn laih anŭn ƀing rơngai leng kơ đuaĭ kơdŏp amăng par laih anŭn amăng anih boh pơtâo ƀơi čư̆. 
and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and have us hidden from [the] face of him that sits upon the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb; @ Gơñu laĭ hăng čư̆ laih anŭn khul boh pơtâo tui anai: “Lĕ trŭn bĕ ƀơi gơmơi laih anŭn pơdŏp gơmơi mơ̆ng ƀô̆ mơta Pô dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao laih anŭn mơ̆ng tơlơi Ană Triu hil. 
because the great day of his wrath is come, and who is able to stand? @ Yua kơ hrơi ƀing Gơñu hil kơtang truh laih, laih anŭn hlơi dưi dŏ dơ̆ng?”
And after this I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding fast the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon any tree. @  Tơdơi kơ anŭn, kâo ƀuh pă čô ling jang dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi pă akiăng lŏn tơnah, gơñu kơ̆ng hĭ pă glung angĭn, kiăng kơ ƀu hmâo angĭn thut ƀơi lŏn tơnah, ƀơi ia rơsĭ ƀôdah ƀơi phŭn kơyâo. 
And I saw another angel ascending from [the] sunrising, having [the] seal of [the] living God; and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the earth and the sea, @ Laih anŭn kâo ƀuh sa čô ling jang pơkŏn dơ̆ng đĭ rai mơ̆ng anih yang hrơi ƀlĕ, djă mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm mơ̆ng Ơi Adai hơdip.

saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we shall have sealed the bondmen of our God upon their foreheads. @ Ñu laĭ: “Anăm ngă sat kơ lŏn tơnah, kơ ia rơsĭ, ƀôdah kơ khul kơyâo pơtâo ôh, tơl ƀing gơmơi hmâo kơđŏm laih ƀơi athơi ƀing ding kơna Ơi Adai ƀing ta.” 
And I heard the number of the sealed, a hundred [and] forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of [the] sons of Israel: @ Kâo hmư̆ mrô ƀing mơnuih hmâo gru kơđŏm: Hmâo sa rơtuh pă pluh pă rơbâo čô mơ̆ng abih bang kơnŭng djuai ană Israel.

After these things I saw, and lo, a great crowd, which no one could number, out of every nation and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palm branches in their hands. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn, kâo lăng, anai nê hmâo sa phung mơnuih lu biă mă arăng ƀu dưi yap ôh, mơ̆ng abih bang lŏn čar, mơ̆ng abih bang kơnŭng djuai, mơ̆ng abih bang djuai mơnuih, laih anŭn abih bang tơlơi pơhiăp.

And they cry with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb. @ Gơñu ur dreo tui anai: “Tơlơi pơklaih lơ̆m kơ Ơi Adai ƀing ta, Pô dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao, laih anŭn lơ̆m kơ Ană Triu!” 
And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders, and the four living creatures, and fell before the throne upon their faces, and worshipped God, @ Laih anŭn abih bang ƀing ling jang dŏ dơ̆ng jum dar gre pơtao, jum dar ƀing kŏng tha laih anŭn pă drơi hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip, ƀing gơñu bon kŭp ƀô̆ ƀơi anăp gre pơtao laih anŭn kơkuh pơpŭ Ơi Adai,

And one of the elders answered, saying to me, These who are clothed with white robes, who are they, and whence came they? @ Sa čô amăng ƀing kŏng tha tơña kơ kâo tui anai: “Ƀing hlơi buh ao phyung kŏ anŭn, laih anŭn mơ̆ng pă ƀing gơñu rai?” 
And I said to him, My lord, *thou* knowest. And he said to me, These are they who come out of the great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb. @ Kâo laĭ glaĭ: “Ơ Khua, ih yơh thâo tơlơi anŭn.” Ñu laĭ kơ kâo: “Anai jing ƀing mơnuih tơbiă rai mơ̆ng tơlơi tơnap tap prŏng.

Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple, and he that sits upon the throne shall spread his tabernacle over them. @ Yua kơ anŭn yơh ƀing gơñu dưi dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp gre pơtao Ơi Adai, hrơi mlam buih bruă Ơi Adai amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ Ñu; laih anŭn Pô dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao či gom pơgang gơñu.

And when it opened the seventh seal, there was silence in the heaven about half an hour. @ Tơdang Ană Triu yaih mơnơ̆ng kơđŏm tal tơjuh, amăng adai hmâo tơlơi rơiăt amăng ha mơkrah mông. 
And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. @ Laih anŭn kâo ƀuh tơjuh čô ling jang dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai, laih anŭn arăng brơi ƀing gơñu tơjuh ƀĕ tơdiăp.
And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, that he might give [efficacy] to the prayers of all saints at the golden altar which [was] before the throne. @  Hmâo sa čô ling jang pơkŏn dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp kơƀang ngă yang djă get mơnơ̆ng ƀâu mơngưi ngă hăng mah.

And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast [it] on the earth: and there were voices, and thunders and lightnings, and an earthquake. @ Laih anŭn ling jang mă get mơnơ̆ng ƀâu mơngưi, mă apui mơ̆ng kơƀang ngă yang pioh pơbă get anŭn, laih anŭn glŏm trŭn ƀơi lŏn tơnah. Hmâo khul dơnai grơ̆m, dơnai pơhiăp, khul kơmlă laih anŭn tơlơi pơpư̆ lŏn tơnah.
And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound with [their] trumpets. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn, tơjuh čô ling jang djă tơjuh tơdiăp prăp pre ayŭp.
And the first sounded [his] trumpet: and there was hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth; and the third part of the earth was burnt up, and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. @  Ling jang tal sa ayŭp tơdiăp, tui anŭn hmâo hơjan pler hăng apui pơlŭk hăng drah lĕ trŭn pơ lŏn tơnah.

And the second angel sounded [his] trumpet: and as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea, and the third part of the sea became blood; @ Ling jang tal dua ayŭp tơdiăp, laih anŭn hmâo mơnơ̆ng hrup hăng sa boh čư̆ prŏng apui dŏ ƀơ̆ng arăng glŏm trŭn amăng ia rơsĭ.

and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea which had life died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. @ sa črăn amăng klâo črăn mơnơ̆ng hơdip amăng ia rơsĭ djai hĭ, laih anŭn sa črăn amăng klâo črăn kompăn răm rai hĭ.
And the third angel sounded [his] trumpet: and there fell out of the heaven a great star, burning as a torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters. @  Ling jang tal klâo ayŭp tơdiăp, laih anŭn sa boh pơtŭ prŏng apui ƀơ̆ng jă kar hăng sa ƀĕ apui arok lĕ trŭn mơ̆ng adai. Boh pơtŭ anŭn lĕ trŭn ƀơi sa črăn amăng klâo črăn khul ia krong laih anŭn khul akŏ ia. 
And the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood, and many of the men died of the waters because they were made bitter. @ Anăn pơtŭ anŭn “Kơyâo phĭ”. Sa črăn amăng klâo črăn ia jing hĭ phĭ, laih anŭn lu mơnuih djai yua kơ ia anai, yua kơ ñu jing phĭ hĭ laih.
And the fourth angel sounded [his] trumpet: and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so that the third part of them should be darkened, and that the day should not appear [for] the third part of it, and the night the same. @  Ling jang tal pă ayŭp tơdiăp, laih anŭn sa črăn amăng klâo črăn yang hrơi, sa črăn amăng klâo črăn yang blan, laih anŭn sa črăn amăng klâo črăn khul pơtŭ pơjrơ̆m kơtang tơl sa črăn amăng klâo črăn tơlơi bơngač gơñu jing hĭ mơmŏt, ngă brơi sa črăn amăng klâo črăn tơhrơi rơngiă hĭ tơlơi bơngač, laih anŭn mlam ăt kar kaĭ mơ̆n.
And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them that dwell upon the earth, for the remaining voices of the trumpet of the three angels who are about to sound. @ Kâo lăng laih anŭn hmư̆ sa drơi čĭm klang tơdang ñu pơr tơ̆ng krah adai, ur kraih tui anai: “Răm ƀăm yơh!

And the fifth angel sounded [his] trumpet: and I saw a star out of the heaven fallen to the earth; and there was given to it the key of the pit of the abyss. @ Ling jang tal rơma ayŭp tơdiăp, kâo ƀuh sa boh pơtŭ mơ̆ng adai lĕ trŭn ƀơi lŏn tơnah, arăng brơi kơ pơtŭ anŭn kơmla kăl hlŭng dlam. 
And it opened the pit of the abyss; and there went up smoke out of the pit as [the] smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the pit. @ Pơtŭ anŭn pŏk hlŭng dlam anŭn, laih anŭn mơ̆ng hlŭng dlam anŭn hmâo asăp apui tơbiă đĭ kar hăng asăp apui mơ̆ng sa boh tơpur prŏng biă mă. Yang hrơi laih anŭn rơngit adai jing mơmŏt hĭ yua kơ asăp apui mơ̆ng hlŭng dlam anŭn. 
And out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them as the scorpions of the earth have power; @ Mơ̆ng asăp apui anŭn hmâo khul kơtop tơbiă pơr bra hyu tar ƀar amăng lŏn tơnah, laih anŭn arăng brơi tơlơi dưi kơtang kơ ƀing gơñu kar hăng tơlơi dưi kơtang kơ aguăt ƀơi lŏn tơnah. 
and it was said to them, that they should not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but the men who have not the seal of God on their foreheads: @ Arăng hmâo pơtă kơ ƀing gơñu anăm ngă răm rai ôh kơ rơ̆k ƀơi lŏn tơnah, khul mơnơ̆ng săt mơtah laih anŭn kơyâo pơtâo, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng ngă răm kơ ƀing mơnuih ƀu hmâo ôh mơnơ̆ng Ơi Adai kơđŏm ƀơi athơi gơñu đôč. 
and it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months; and their torment [was] as [the] torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man. @ Arăng brơi kơ ƀing gơñu dưi ngă pơtơnap ƀing mơnuih amăng rơma blan, samơ̆ ƀu dưi pơdjai ƀing gơñu ôh. Tơlơi ruă nuă ƀing gơñu ngă jing kar hăng tơlơi ruă nuă aguăt duĭ. 
And in those days shall men seek death, and shall in no way find it; and shall desire to die, and death flees from them. @ Amăng rơma blan anŭn ƀing gơñu tui hơduah tơlơi djai, samơ̆ ƀu dưi ƀuh ôh. Gơñu kiăng biă mă djai, samơ̆ tơlơi djai đuaĭ ataih hĭ mơ̆ng ƀing gơñu.
And the likenesses of the locusts [were] like to horses prepared for war; and upon their heads as crowns like gold, and their faces as faces of men; @  Rup hơbŏ khul kơtop anŭn lăng hrup hăng khul aseh prăp pre kơ tơlơi pơblah.

and they had hair as women's hair, and their teeth were as of lions, @ ƀuk gơñu kar hăng ƀuk đah kơmơi, laih anŭn tơgơi gơñu kar hăng tơgơi rơmông dŭl. 
and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots of many horses running to war; @ Gơñu hmâo kơmoh gom tơda kar hăng ao pơsơi, laih anŭn dơnai čăng gơñu kar hăng dơnai lu boh rơdeh aseh kơsung nao pơ tơdrŏn pơblah. 
and they have tails like scorpions, and stings; and their power [was] in their tails to hurt men five months. @ Ƀing gơñu hmâo tơku laih anŭn ia bih kar hăng aguăt, amăng khul tơku anŭn hmâo tơlơi dưi kơtang ngă pơruă ană mơnuih amăng rơma blan. 
They have a king over them, the angel of the abyss: his name in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in Greek he has [for] name Apollyon. @ Ling jang kơ hlŭng dlam jing pơtao kơ ƀing gơñu, anăn ñu amăng tơlơi Hêbrơ jing “Abadôn”, laih anŭn amăng tơlơi Grek arăng iâu “Apôliôn”.
The first woe has passed. Behold, there come yet two woes after these things. @ Tơlơi tơnap tap tal sa rơgao hĭ; anai nê ăt dŏ dua tơlơi tơnap tap dơ̆ng či truh.
And the sixth angel sounded [his] trumpet: and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which [is] before God, @  Ling jang tal năm ayŭp tơdiăp, kâo hmư̆ asăp mơ̆ng pă akiăng kơƀang ngă yang ngă hăng mah dŏ ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai. 
saying to the sixth angel that had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates. @ Asăp anŭn laĭ kơ ling jang tal năm pô djă tơdiăp: “Kleh bĕ pă čô ling jang arăng dŏ čaŏ ƀơi ia krong Ơphrat.” 
And the four angels were loosed, who are prepared for the hour and day and month and year, that they might slay the third part of men; @ Tui anŭn, arăng kleh hĭ pă čô ling jang jing ƀing hmâo prăp pre laih kơ mông, kơ hrơi, kơ blan, laih anŭn kơ thŭn kiăng kơ ƀing gơñu pơdjai hĭ sa črăn amăng klâo črăn mơnuih mơnam. 
and the number of the hosts of horse [was] twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number. @ Mrô tơhan đĭ aseh hmâo dua rơtuh klăk. Anŭn yơh mrô ƀing gơñu kâo hmâo hmư̆. 
And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sat upon them, having breastplates of fire and jacinth and brimstone; and the heads of the horses [were] as heads of lions, and out of their mouths goes out fire and smoke and brimstone. @ Amăng tơlơi pơƀuh, kâo ƀuh aseh laih anŭn ƀing mơnuih đĭ aseh tui anai: Ƀing gơñu buh ao pơsơi pơgang tơda gơñu mriah kar hăng apui, mơtah kar hăng boh pơtâo bơngač, laih anŭn kơñĭ kar hăng apui kơsŭm; akŏ aseh kar hăng akŏ rơmông dŭl laih anŭn amăng bah gơñu bluh tơbiă apui, asăp laih anŭn apui kơsŭm. 
By these three plagues were the third part of men killed, by the fire and the smoke and the brimstone which goes out of their mouths. @ Sa črăn amăng klâo črăn mơnuih mơnam djai yua kơ klâo mơta tơlơi răm rai anai: apui, asăp apui, laih anŭn apui kơsŭm tơbiă mơ̆ng amăng bah aseh anŭn. 
For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails: for their tails [are] like serpents, having heads, and with them they injure. @ Yua kơ tơlơi kơtang aseh anŭn dŏ ƀơi amăng bah laih anŭn ƀơi tơku gơñu. Aku gơñu kar hăng ala hmâo akŏ, laih anŭn hăng akŏ anŭn yơh gơñu ngă răm rai mơnuih mơnam.
And the rest of men who were not killed with these plagues repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and the golden and silver and brazen and stone and wooden idols, which can neither see nor hear nor walk. @  Đơ ƀing mơnuih dŏ glaĭ, jing ƀing ƀu djai ôh yua kơ tơlơi răm rai anŭn, ăt ƀu kơhmal ôh kơ bruă tơngan ƀing gơñu ngă, kŏn lui lơi tơlơi kơkuh pơpŭ kơ yang sat, kơ rup trah ngă hăng mah, hăng prăk, hăng kong, hăng boh pơtâo, laih anŭn hăng kơyâo, khul rup trah anŭn ƀu thâo ƀuh, ƀu thâo hmư̆ laih anŭn ƀu thâo rơbat lơi. 
And they repented not of their murders, nor of their witchcrafts, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. @ Ƀing gơñu ăt ƀu kơhmal ôh kơ tơlơi ƀing gơñu pơdjai mơnuih, kơ tơlơi ngă pơjâu, kơ tơlơi rih răm ƀôdah kơ tơlơi ƀing gơñu klĕ dŏp.
And I saw another strong angel coming down out of the heaven, clothed with a cloud, and the rainbow upon his head, and his countenance as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire, @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, kâo ƀuh sa čô ling jang pơkŏn bă hăng tơlơi dưi kơtang trŭn rai mơ̆ng adai, hmâo ƀŭt kơthul gom ñu. Hmâo mrơ̆t jum dar akŏ ñu, ƀô̆ mơta ñu kar hăng yang hrơi, laih anŭn tơkai ñu kar hăng tơmeh apui. 
and having in his hand a little opened book. And he set his right foot on the sea, and the left upon the earth, @ Amăng tơngan ñu djă sa čơkul hră klĭ anĕt pŏk hĭ laih. Tơkai gah hơnuă ñu juă ƀơi ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn tơkai gah iao ñu juă ƀơi lŏn. 
and cried with a loud voice as a lion roars. And when he cried, the seven thunders uttered their own voices. @ Ñu ur hăng asăp kraih kar hăng sa drơi rơmông dŭl grañ. Tơdang ñu ur, hmâo tơjuh dơnai grơ̆m kuang đĭ. 
And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write: and I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Seal the things which the seven thunders have spoken, and write them not. @ Tŏ tui tơjuh grơ̆m kuang đĭ, kâo pơmĭn či čih pioh, samơ̆ kâo hmư̆ asăp mơ̆ng adai laĭ: “Kơđơ̆l kơđŏm hĭ bĕ khul tơlơi tơjuh dơnai grơ̆m anŭn hmâo laĭ laih; anăm čih pioh ôh.”
And the angel whom I saw stand on the sea and on the earth lifted up his right hand to the heaven, @  Ling jang kâo hmâo ƀuh dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi ia rơsĭ laih anŭn ƀơi lŏn yơr tơngan hơnuă ñu pơ adai, 
and swore by him that lives to the ages of ages, who created the heaven and the things that are in it, and the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there should be no longer delay; @ hăng anăn Pô hơdip hlŏng lar, jing Pô hrih pơjing adai laih anŭn abih bang mơnơ̆ng amăng adai, lŏn tơnah laih anŭn abih bang mơnơ̆ng ƀơi lŏn tơnah, ia rơsĭ laih anŭn abih bang mơnơ̆ng amăng ia rơsĭ, ñu ƀuăn rơ̆ng tui anai: “Ƀu či pơhrưĭ dơ̆ng ôh, 
but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God also shall be completed, as he has made known the glad tidings to his own bondmen the prophets. @ samơ̆ truh hrơi ling jang tal tơjuh ayŭp tơdiăp, Ơi Adai či ngă pơgiơ̆ng hĭ tơlơi yom hơgơ̆m Ñu, kar hăng Ñu hmâo pơhaih laih kơ ƀing ding kơna Ñu, jing ƀing pô laĭ lui hlâo.”
And the voice which I heard out of the heaven [was] again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book which is opened in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the earth. @  Asăp kâo hmâo hmư̆ laih mơ̆ng adai pơhiăp hăng kâo dơ̆ng: “Nao bĕ, mă čơkul hră klĭ hmâo pŏk laih amăng tơngan ling jang hlăk dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi ia rơsĭ laih anŭn ƀơi lŏn.” 
And I went to the angel, saying to him to give me the little book. And he says to me, Take and eat it up: and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey. @ Tui anŭn, kâo nao pơ ling jang, laih anŭn rơkâo kơ ñu brơi kâo čơkul hră klĭ anĕt anŭn. Ñu laĭ: “Mă laih anŭn ƀơ̆ng bĕ; ñu či jing hĭ phĭ amăng hlŭng ih, samơ̆ či jing mơmih hrup hăng ia hơni ƀơi amăng bah ih.” 
And I took the little book out of the hand of the angel, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth as honey, sweet; and when I had eaten it my belly was made bitter. @ Kâo mă čơkul hră klĭ anĕt anŭn mơ̆ng tơngan ling jang laih anŭn kâo ƀơ̆ng. Ñu jing mơmih kar ia hơni ƀơi amăng bah kâo, samơ̆ giơ̆ng kâo lun laih ñu, ñu jing hĭ phĭ amăng hlŭng kâo. 
And it was said to me, Thou must prophesy again as to peoples and nations and tongues and many kings. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn gơñu laĭ kơ kâo: “Ih ăt khŏm laĭ lui hlâo kơ lu djuai mơnuih, lu lŏn čar, lu khul tơlơi pơhiăp laih anŭn kơ lu pơtao dơ̆ng.”
And there was given to me a reed like a staff, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship in it. @  Hlăk anŭn arăng brơi kơ kâo sa ƀĕ gai pơkă hrup hăng sa ƀĕ gai jra, laih anŭn ñu pơtă kâo: “Tơgŭ bĕ laih anŭn pơkă sang kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai, kơƀang ngă yang, laih anŭn ƀing kơkuh pơpŭ amăng anŭn. 
And the court which [is] without the temple cast out, and measure it not; because it has been given [up] to the nations, and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months. @ Samơ̆ anăm pơkă ôh wăl gah rơngiao kơ sang kơkuh pơpŭ; yua kơ arăng hmâo jao laih ñu kơ ƀing djuai tuai, laih anŭn ƀing gơñu či juă hĭ plei rơgoh hiam amăng pă pluh dua blan. 
And I will give [power] to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred [and] sixty days, clothed in sackcloth. @ Kâo či brơi dua čô pô gơ̆ng jơlan kơ Kâo buh ao kơƀao laih anŭn dưi laĭ lui hlâo amăng sa rơbâo dua rơtuh năm pluh hrơi.”
These are the two olive trees and the two lamps which stand before the Lord of the earth; @  Ƀing anŭn jing dua ƀĕ phŭn kơyâo ôliwơ laih anŭn dua ƀĕ gơ̆ng apui kơđen dŏ dơ̆ng ƀơi anăp Khua Yang kơ lŏn tơnah. 
and if any one wills to injure them, fire goes out of their mouth, and devours their enemies. And if any one wills to injure them, thus must he be killed. @ Tơdah hlơi kiăng ngă sat kơ dua čô anai, apui tơbiă mơ̆ng amăng bah gơñu čuh hĭ ƀing ayăt gơñu; hlơi pô kiăng ngă sat kơ ƀing gơñu, gơñu khŏm či tŭ tơlơi pơdjai kar hăng anŭn yơh. 
These have power to shut the heaven that no rain may fall during the days of their prophecy; and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth as often as they will with every plague. @ Gơñu hmâo tơlơi dưi krư̆ hĭ adai, kiăng kơ ƀu hmâo ia hơjan ôh amăng khul hrơi gơñu laĭ lui hlâo; gơñu ăt hmâo tơlơi dưi pơblih ia jing hĭ drah mơ̆n, laih anŭn dưi yua djŏp mơta tơlơi răm ruă ngă sat kơ lŏn tơnah tui hluai hăng gơñu kiăng.
And when they shall have completed their testimony, the beast who comes up out of the abyss shall make war with them, and shall conquer them, and shall kill them: @  Tơ dua gơñu hmâo ngă gơ̆ng jơlan giơ̆ng laih, hlô glai tơbiă đĭ mơ̆ng hlŭng dlam pơblah hăng gơñu, hlô anŭn dưi hĭ hăng gơñu laih anŭn pơdjai hĭ gơñu. 
and their body [shall be] on the street of the great city, which is called spiritually Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified. @ Drơi jan djai dua gơñu či đih ƀơi jơlan glung kơ plei prŏng, arăng iâu hăng anăn rup pơhmô jing Sôđôm laih anŭn čar Êjip, anih arăng hmâo pơ̆ng pơdjai laih Khua Yang gơñu ƀơi kơyâo bơrơkal. 
And [men] of the peoples and tribes and tongues and nations see their body three days and a half, and they do not suffer their bodies to be put into a sepulchre. @ Mơnuih mơ̆ng abih khul djuai mơnuih, abih kơnŭng djuai, abih tơlơi pơhiăp, abih lŏn čar či ep lăng kơ drơi jan djai gơñu amăng klâo hrơi mơkrah, laih anŭn ƀu brơi arăng dơr hĭ amăng pơsat ôh. 
And they that dwell upon the earth rejoice over them, and are full of delight, and shall send gifts one to another, because these, the two prophets, tormented them that dwell upon the earth. @ Ƀing mơnuih dŏ ƀơi lŏn tơnah či hơ̆k mơak yua kơ gơñu, hơ̆k kơdơ̆k mơit nao rai gơnam brơi tơdruă gơñu, yua kơ dua čô pô laĭ lui hlâo anai hmâo ngă pơtơnap laih kơ ƀing mơnuih dŏ ƀơi lŏn tơnah. 
And after the three days and a half [the] spirit of life from God came into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those beholding them. @ Tơdơi kơ klâo hrơi mơkrah, jua hơdip mơ̆ng Ơi Adai mŭt amăng dua gơñu, laih anŭn gơñu tơgŭ dơ̆ng, ngă brơi ƀing ƀuh gơñu hwĭ biă mă. 
And I heard a great voice out of the heaven saying to them, Come up here; and they went up to the heaven in the cloud, and their enemies beheld them. @ Dua gơñu hmư̆ asăp kraih mơ̆ng adai laĭ kơ dua gơñu tui anai: “Đĭ pơ anai bĕ!” Laih anŭn gơñu đĭ pơ adai amăng ƀŭt hiăng ƀơi anăp mơta ƀing ayăt gơñu. 
And in that hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand names of men were slain in the earthquake. And the remnant were filled with fear, and gave glory to the God of the heaven. @ Ƀơi mông anŭn hmâo tơlơi pơpư̆ lŏn tơnah kơtang, sa črăn amăng pluh črăn plei prŏng răm rai.

The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe comes quickly. @ Tơlơi tơnap tal dua rơgao hĭ; anai nê tơlơi tơnap tap tal klâo či truh tañ.
And the seventh angel sounded [his] trumpet: and there were great voices in the heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world of our Lord and of his Christ is come, and he shall reign to the ages of ages. @  Ling jang tal tơjuh ayŭp tơdiăp, hmâo asăp kraih mơ̆ng adai, laĭ:

And the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, @ Ƀing dua pluh pă čô kŏng tha dŏ ber ƀơi gre pơtao ƀơi anăp Ơi Adai, gơñu bon kŭp ƀô̆ laih anŭn kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai,

And the nations have been full of wrath, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead to be judged, and to give the recompense to thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and to those who fear thy name, small and great; and to destroy those that destroy the earth. @  Ƀing djuai mơnuih hil kơtang tĭt,

And the temple of God in the heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and an earthquake, and great hail. @  Sang kơkuh pơpŭ kơ Ơi Adai amăng adai pŏk hĭ, amăng lăm arăng ƀuh hmâo Hip Kơnol Pơgop Ñu, laih anŭn hmâo khul kơmlă, asăp pơhiăp, asăp grơ̆m, lŏn tơnah pơpư̆ laih anŭn hơjan pler prŏng.
And a great sign was seen in the heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars; @ Hmâo sa gru kơnăl prŏng tơbiă rai amăng adai adih: Sa čô đah kơmơi hmâo yang hrơi gom jum dar ñu, laih anŭn yang blan ƀơi gah yŭ tơkai ñu, ƀơi akŏ ñu hmâo sa boh mŭk pơtao ngă hăng pluh dua asar pơtŭ.

And another sign was seen in the heaven: and behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems; @ Giơ̆ng anŭn amăng adai tơbiă rai gru kơnăl pơkŏn dơ̆ng: Hmâo sa drơi ana grai mriah prŏng hmâo tơjuh boh akŏ, pluh ƀĕ tơki, laih anŭn ƀơi tơjuh boh akŏ hmâo tơjuh boh mŭk pơtao. 
and his tail draws the third part of the stars of the heaven; and he cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, in order that when she brought forth he might devour her child. @ Aku ñu hua ba sa črăn amăng klâo črăn pơtŭ amăng adai, laih anŭn glŏm hĭ ƀing gơ̆ pơ lŏn tơnah.

And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has there a place prepared of God, that they should nourish her there a thousand two hundred [and] sixty days. @ Samơ̆ đah kơmơi anŭn đuaĭ kơdŏp amăng tơdrŏn har, pơ anŭn Ơi Adai hmâo prăp pre brơi laih kơ ñu sa boh anih, kiăng kơ ñu dưi hmâo mơnơ̆ng ƀơ̆ng huă amăng sa rơbâo dua rơtuh năm pluh hrơi.
And there was war in the heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon. And the dragon fought, and his angels; @  Hlăk anŭn hmâo sa tơlơi pơblah amăng adai, Mikel hăng ƀing ling jang ñu pơblah hăng ana grai; ana grai laih anŭn ding kơna ñu ăt pơblah glaĭ mơ̆n.

And the great dragon was cast out, the ancient serpent, he who is called Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole habitable world, he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. @ Laih anŭn arăng glŏm trŭn hĭ ana grai prŏng pơ lŏn tơnah, jing ala đưm adih, arăng pia ñu jing Yang Sat ƀôdah Satan, pô plư pleč abih bang mơnuih mơnam amăng lŏn tơnah.

And I heard a great voice in the heaven saying, Now is come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren has been cast out, who accused them before our God day and night: @  Kâo hmư̆ amăng adai asăp kraih laĭ:

and *they* have overcome him by reason of the blood of the Lamb, and by reason of the word of their testimony, and have not loved their life even unto death. @ Ƀing gơñu hmâo dưi hĭ laih hăng ñu yua mơ̆ng drah Ană Triu,

And when the dragon saw that he had been cast out into the earth, he persecuted the woman which bore the male [child]. @ Tơ ana grai thâo Ơi Adai glŏm trŭn laih ñu pơ lŏn tơnah, ñu kiaŏ tui đah kơmơi hmâo tơkeng laih ană đah rơkơi anŭn. 
And there were given to the woman the two wings of the great eagle, that she might fly into the desert into her place, where she is nourished there a time, and times, and half a time, from [the] face of the serpent. @ Samơ̆ arăng brơi kơ đah kơmơi anŭn dua pŏk čăng čĭm klang prŏng, kiăng kơ ñu dưi pơr đuaĭ mơ̆ng ana grai nao pơ anih ñu amăng tơdrŏn tač, ƀơi anŭn arăng či čem ñu amăng sa rơnŭk, lu rơnŭk laih anŭn sa mơkrah rơnŭk. 
And the serpent cast out of his mouth behind the woman water as a river, that he might make her be [as] one carried away by a river. @ Ana grai pruih tơbiă ia mơ̆ng amăng bah ñu hrup hăng ia krong tui klon đah kơmơi, kiăng kơr pơđuaĭ hĭ ñu. 
And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth. @ Samơ̆ lŏn djru pơklaih đah kơmơi anŭn, lŏn ha amăng bah laih anŭn lun hĭ ia krong ana grai pruih mơ̆ng amăng bah ñu anŭn. 
And the dragon was angry with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus. @ Ana grai hil biă mă kơ đah kơmơi anŭn, laih anŭn ñu nao pơblah hăng ƀing ană kơ đah kơmơi anŭn dŏ glaĭ, jing ƀing tui gưt boh pơhiăp Ơi Adai pơtă laih anŭn hmâo tơlơi Yêsu ngă gơ̆ng jơlan. 
And I stood upon the sand of the sea; and I saw a beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and upon its horns ten diadems, and upon its heads names of blasphemy. @  Giơ̆ng anŭn kâo ƀuh sa drơi hlô glai tơbiă mơ̆ng ia rơsĭ, hmâo pluh ƀĕ tơki laih anŭn tơjuh boh akŏ.

And the beast which I saw was like to a leopardess, and its feet as of a bear, and its mouth as a lion's mouth; and the dragon gave to it his power, and his throne, and great authority; @ Sa amăng tơjuh boh akŏ ñu hrup hăng hmâo tơlơi rơka kơtang, samơ̆ anih rơka anŭn hmâo hlao hĭ laih, laih anŭn abih bang lŏn tơnah hling hlang biă mă laih anŭn đuaĭ tui hlô glai anŭn.

And they did homage to the dragon, because he gave the authority to the beast; and they did homage to the beast, saying, Who [is] like to the beast? and who can make war with it? @  Arăng brơi kơ hlô anŭn amăng bah pơhiăp pơgao laih anŭn ƀrưh hmiah kơ Ơi Adai, ñu hmâo tơlơi dưi wai lăng amăng pă pluh dua blan.

And it opened its mouth for blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, and those who have their tabernacle in the heaven. @ Kar kaĭ mơ̆n arăng brơi kơ ñu dưi nao pơblah hăng ƀing rơgoh hiam laih anŭn ñu dưi hĭ hăng ƀing gơ̆.

And there was given to it to make war with the saints, and to overcome them; and there was given to it authority over every tribe, and people, and tongue, and nation; @ Abih bang mơnuih hơdip ƀơi lŏn tơnah či kơkuh pơpŭ kơ ñu, jing ƀing mơnuih ƀu hmâo ôh anăn čih amăng hơdrôm hră tơlơi hơdip Ană Triu, Pô arăng hmâo pơdjai laih hlâo kơ hrơi hrih lŏn tơnah. 
and all that dwell on the earth shall do it homage, [every one] whose name had not been written from [the] founding of [the] world in the book of life of the slain Lamb. @ Hlơi pô hmâo tơngia, brơi ñu hmư̆ bĕ!

If any one [leads] into captivity, he goes into captivity. If any one shall kill with [the] sword, he must with [the] sword be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints. @ Tơdơi kơ anŭn kâo ƀuh sa drơi hlô glai pơkŏn tơbiă đĭ mơ̆ng lŏn.

And I saw another beast rising out of the earth; and it had two horns like to a lamb, and spake as a dragon; @ Ñu yua abih tơlơi dưi prŏng hlô tal sa ƀơi anăp hlô glai tal sa anŭn, ñu ngă brơi lŏn tơnah laih anŭn abih bang ƀing mơnuih dŏ ƀơi lŏn tơnah kơkuh pơpŭ kơ hlô tal sa, jing hlô rơka kơtang hmâo hlao laih. 
and it exercises all the authority of the first beast before it, and causes the earth and those that dwell in it to do homage to the first beast, whose wound of death was healed. @ Ñu ngă lu gru kơnăl prŏng, tơl ngă brơi apui mơ̆ng adai lĕ trŭn pơ lŏn tơnah ƀơi anăp mơnuih;

And it deceives those that dwell upon the earth by reason of the signs which it was given to it to work before the beast, saying to those that dwell upon the earth to make an image to the beast, which has the wound of the sword, and lived. @ Ñu ăt hmâo tơlơi dưi brơi jua suă pran kơ rup hlô anŭn, kiăng kơ rup hlô dưi pơhiăp, laih anŭn brơi arăng pơdjai hĭ ƀing ƀu kơkuh pơpŭ ôh kơ rup hlô anŭn. 
And it was given to it to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should also speak, and should cause that as many as should not do homage to the image of the beast should be killed. @ Ñu ăt ngă brơi abih bang mơnuih, ƀing anĕt wơ̆t ƀing prŏng, ƀing pơdrŏng wơ̆t ƀing ƀun rin, ƀing rơngai wơ̆t ƀing hlŭn leng kơ hmâo gru kơnăl ƀơi tơngan gah hơnuă ƀôdah ƀơi athơi ƀing gơñu, 
And it causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the free and the bondmen, that they should give them a mark upon their right hand or upon their forehead; @ kiăng kơ ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi blơi ƀôdah sĭ mia tơdah gơñu ƀu hmâo ôh hră čih anăn hlô ƀôdah mrô hlô.
and that no one should be able to buy or sell save he that had the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of its name. @ Amăng tơlơi anai khŏm hmâo tơlơi kơhnâo.

And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing upon mount Zion, and with him a hundred [and] forty-four thousand, having his name and the name of his Father written upon their foreheads. @  Kâo lăng, anai nê Ană Triu dŏ ƀơi čư̆ Siôn, laih anŭn hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Ñu hmâo sa rơtuh pă pluh pă rơbâo čô mơnuih hmâo anăn Ană Triu, laih anŭn anăn Ama kơ Ană Triu hmâo čih laih ƀơi athơi ƀing gơñu. 
And I heard a voice out of the heaven as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of great thunder. And the voice which I heard [was] as of harp-singers harping with their harps; @ Kâo hmư̆ asăp mơ̆ng adai kar hăng dơnai lu glung ia, laih anŭn kar hăng dơnai grơ̆m kơtang.

and they sing a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. And no one could learn that song save the hundred [and] forty-four thousand who were bought from the earth. @ Laih anŭn gơñu adoh sa tơlơi adoh phrâo ƀơi anăp gre pơtao, ƀơi anăp pă drơi hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip, laih anŭn ƀơi anăp ƀing kŏng tha.

These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins: these are they who follow the Lamb wheresoever it goes. These have been bought from men [as] first-fruits to God and to the Lamb: @ Ƀing anŭn yơh jing ƀing aka ƀu pơgrĭ gơñu pô hăng đah kơmơi ôh, yua kơ ƀing gơñu jing ƀing dra hmŭm.

And I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven, having [the] everlasting glad tidings to announce to those settled on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and tongue and people, @ Giơ̆ng anŭn kâo ƀuh sa čô ling jang pơkŏn pơr tơ̆ng krah adai.

saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give him glory, for the hour of his judgment has come; and do homage to him who has made the heaven and the earth and the sea and fountains of waters. @ Ñu laĭ hăng asăp kraih: “Hwĭ pơpŭ bĕ kơ Ơi Adai laih anŭn pơpŭ bơni kơ Ñu, yua kơ mông Ñu phat kơđi truh laih.

And another, a second, angel followed, saying, Great Babylon has fallen, has fallen, which of the wine of the fury of her fornication has made all nations drink. @  Sa čô ling jang pơkŏn, jing pô tal dua tui klon ñu laih anŭn laĭ: “Plei prŏng Babilôn tơglưh laih, tơglưh laih!

And another, a third, angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any one do homage to the beast and its image, and receive a mark upon his forehead or upon his hand, @ Sa čô ling jang pơkŏn, jing pô tal klâo, tui klon ñu laih anŭn laĭ hăng asăp kraih: “Tơdah hlơi kơkuh pơpŭ kơ hlô laih anŭn kơ rup ñu, laih anŭn mă tŭ gru ƀơi athơi ƀôdah ƀơi tơngan ñu,

And the smoke of their torment goes up to ages of ages, and they have no respite day and night who do homage to the beast and to its image, and if any one receive the mark of its name. @ Asăp apui tơlơi tơnap tap ƀing anŭn pơr đĭ nanao hlŏng lar.

Here is the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. @ Anai yơh tơlơi gir kơ ƀing rơgoh hiam, jing ƀing djă pioh kơjăp tơlơi Ơi Adai pơtă laih anŭn tơlơi đaŏ kơ Yêsu.
And I heard a voice out of the heaven saying, Write, Blessed the dead who die in [the] Lord from henceforth. Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them. @ Kâo hmư̆ asăp mơ̆ng adai laĭ: “Čih bĕ tơlơi anai: Mơ̆ng ră anai pơ anăp, mơyun hiam yơh kơ ƀing djai jing ƀing djai amăng Khua Yang!” Yang Bơngăt Hiam laĭ: “Sĭt biă mă, gơñu či pơdơi mơ̆ng tơlơi gleh glăn gơñu, laih anŭn khul bruă gơñu đuaĭ tui gơñu.”
And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting like [the] Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. @  Giơ̆ng anŭn kâo lăng, anai nê hmâo sa ƀŭt hiăng kŏ; ƀơi hiăng anŭn hmâo sa čô hrup hăng Ană Mơnuih hlăk dŏ ber.

And another angel came out of the temple which [is] in the heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. @ Sa čô ling jang pơkŏn tơbiă mơ̆ng sang kơkuh pơpŭ amăng adai. Ñu ăt hmâo sa ƀĕ mơnek ƀơ̆ng kar kaĭ mơ̆n.
And another angel came out of the altar, having power over fire, and called with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle, and gather the bunches of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripened. @ Sa čô ling jang pơkŏn tơbiă mơ̆ng kơƀang ngă yang, pô hmâo tơlơi dưi ƀơi apui, hăng asăp kraih ñu iâu pô hmâo mơnek ƀơ̆ng biă mă, laĭ: “Yơr mơnek ih laih anŭn trơĭ bĕ khul boh kơƀâu ƀơi lŏn tơnah, yua kơ boh kơƀâu tơsă laih.” 
And the angel put his sickle to the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast [the bunches] into the great wine-press of the fury of God; @ Tui anŭn ling jang anŭn glŏm mơnek ñu pơ lŏn tơnah, laih anŭn trơĭ khul kơtul boh kơƀâu ƀơi lŏn tơnah, laih anŭn glŏm boh kơƀâu anŭn amăng kơthŭng djet prŏng kơ tơlơi Ơi Adai hil.

And I saw as a glass sea, mingled with fire, and those that had gained the victory over the beast, and over its image, and over the number of its name, standing upon the glass sea, having harps of God. @ Kâo ƀuh sa mơnơ̆ng hơgĕt hrup hăng ia rơsĭ mơnĭl pơlŭk hăng apui, laih anŭn ƀing mơnuih hmâo dưi hĭ laih hăng hlô, hăng rup ñu, hăng mrô kơ anăn ñu, dŏ dơ̆ng jĕ ia rơsĭ mơnĭl, djă gong Ơi Adai amăng tơngan ñu. 
And they sing the song of Moses bondman of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and wonderful [are] thy works, Lord God Almighty; righteous and true [are] thy ways, O King of nations. @ Ƀing gơñu adoh tơlơi adoh Môis, ding kơna Ơi Adai, laih anŭn tơlơi adoh Ană Triu, tui anai:

And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of witness in the heaven was opened; @  Giơ̆ng anŭn kâo ƀuh sang kơkuh pơpŭ, jing Sang Khăn Gơ̆ng Jơlan amăng adai pŏk hĭ. 
and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, clothed in pure bright linen, and girded about the breasts with golden girdles. @ Laih anŭn tơjuh čô ling jang djă tơjuh mơta tơlơi răm ruă tơbiă mơ̆ng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, buh ao kơbuă rơgoh bơngač laih anŭn hrăng bơnal mah ƀơi tơda. 
And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls, full of the fury of God, who lives to the ages of ages. @ Sa drơi amăng pă drơi hlô mơnơ̆ng hơdip brơi kơ tơjuh čô ling jang tơjuh boh čơlŭ mah bă hăng tơlơi Ơi Adai hil, Pô hơdip hlŏng lar. 
And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power: and no one could enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed. @ Sang kơkuh pơpŭ bă hăng asăp apui mơ̆ng tơlơi ang yang Ơi Adai laih anŭn mơ̆ng tơlơi mơyang Ñu, ƀu hmâo hlơi dưi mŭt amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ tơl tơjuh mơta tơlơi răm ruă mơ̆ng tơjuh čô ling jang hmâo pơgiơ̆ng hĭ.
And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven bowls of the fury of God upon the earth. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn kâo hmư̆ asăp kraih tơbiă mơ̆ng sang kơkuh pơpŭ laĭ kơ tơjuh čô ling jang: “Nao tuh bĕ pơ lŏn tơnah tơjuh boh čơlŭ tơlơi Ơi Adai hil.”
And the first went and poured out his bowl on the earth; and there came an evil and grievous sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped its image. @  Tui anŭn ling jang tal sa nao laih anŭn tuh čơlŭ ñu pơ lŏn tơnah.

And the second poured out his bowl on the sea; and it became blood, as of a dead man; and every living soul died in the sea. @ Ling jang tal dua tuh čơlŭ ñu amăng ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn ia rơsĭ jing hĭ hrup hăng drah mơnuih djai, laih anŭn abih bang mơnơ̆ng hơdip dŏ amăng ia rơsĭ leng kơ djai hĭ soh sel.

And I heard the angel of the waters saying, Thou art righteous, who art and wast, the holy one, that thou hast judged so; @ Kâo hmư̆ ling jang wai lăng ia rơsĭ laĭ:

And I heard the altar saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous [are] thy judgments. @ Laih anŭn kâo hmư̆ asăp pơhiăp mơ̆ng kơƀang ngă yang laĭ:

And the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun; and it was given to it to burn men with fire. @ Ling Jang tal pă tuh čơlŭ ñu ƀơi yang hrơi, yang hrơi hmâo tơlơi dưi yua apui čuh ană mơnuih. 
And the men were burnt with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, who had authority over these plagues, and did not repent to give him glory. @ Tơlơi pơ-iă kơtang čuh hĭ ană mơnuih, laih anŭn ƀing gơñu hơtơ̆m pah kơ anăn Ơi Adai, Pô hmâo tơlơi dưi ƀơi tơlơi răm ruă anŭn.

And the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast; and its kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues with distress, @ Ling Jang tal rơma tuh čơlŭ ñu ƀơi gre pơtao hlô, laih anŭn dêh čar pơtao hlô jing hĭ kơnăm mơmŏt; laih anŭn ană mơnuih kĕ jơlah gơñu pô yua kơ ruă nuă biă mă. 
and blasphemed the God of the heaven for their distresses and their sores, and did not repent of their works. @ Ƀing gơñu hơtơ̆m pah kơ Ơi Adai amăng adai yua kơ tơlơi ruă nuă laih anŭn yua kơ teng gơñu, samơ̆ ƀu kơhmal ôh kơ khul bruă gơñu ngă.
And the sixth poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared. @  Ling jang tal năm tuh čơlŭ ñu ƀơi ia krong prŏng Ơphrat, ia krong anŭn thu hĭ, kiăng pơkra jơlan brơi kơ ƀing pơtao mơ̆ng čar gah ngŏ. 
And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, as frogs; @ Kâo ƀuh mơ̆ng amăng bah ana grai, mơ̆ng amăng bah hlô, laih anŭn mơ̆ng amăng bah pô laĭ lui hlâo ƀlor klâo čô yang grĭ hơƀak hrup hăng ajĭ tơbiă rai. 
for they are [the] spirits of demons, doing signs; which go out to the kings of the whole habitable world to gather them together to the war of [that] great day of God the Almighty. @ Gơñu jing bơngăt yang sat, ngă khul gru kơnăl, nao pơ ƀing pơtao kơ abih bang lŏn tơnah, kiăng pơƀŭt glaĭ gơñu kơ tơlơi pơblah ƀơi hrơi prŏng Ơi Adai Dưi Kơtang. 
(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed [is] he that watches and keeps his garments, that he may not walk naked, and that they [may not] see his shame.) @ “Anai nê, kâo rai hrup hăng mơnuih klĕ!

And he gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armagedon. @ Ƀing yang sat anŭn pơƀŭt glaĭ ƀing pơtao ƀơi sa anih arăng pia amăng tơlơi Hêbrơ Harmagêdôn.
And the seventh poured out his bowl on the air; and there came out a great voice from the temple of the heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. @ Ling jang tal tơjuh tuh čơlŭ ñu amăng angĭn, laih anŭn hmâo asăp kraih tơbiă mơ̆ng gre pơtao amăng sang kơkuh pơpŭ, laĭ: “Giơ̆ng laih yơh!” 
And there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, such an earthquake, so great. @ Laih anŭn hmâo kơmlă, dơnai pơhiăp, dơnai grơ̆m, laih anŭn lŏn tơnah pơpư̆ kơtang biă mă, aka hmâo djơ̆ ôh tơlơi pơpư̆ lŏn tơnah kơtang kar hăng anŭn čơdơ̆ng mơ̆ng hmâo mơnuih ƀơi lŏn tơnah. 
And the great city was [divided] into three parts; and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. @ Plei prŏng čơđang pơpha hĭ jing klâo črăn, laih anŭn khul plei prŏng amăng abih bang lŏn čar tơglưh hĭ, laih anŭn Ơi Adai hơdơr kơ plei prŏng Babilôn, kiăng brơi ñu mơñum čơlŭ tơpai tơlơi Ơi Adai hil kơtang. 
And every island fled, and mountains were not found; @ Abih bang plao ia rơsĭ đuaĭ kơdŏp laih anŭn khul bul čư̆ arăng ƀu ƀuh dơ̆ng tah. 
and a great hail, as of a talent weight, comes down out of the heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, for the plague of it is exceeding great. @ Hmâo hơjan pler prŏng, boh kơtraŏ ñu sa boh rơma pluh kilôgram, mơ̆ng adai lĕ trŭn ƀơi ană mơnuih, tơl ană mơnuih hơtơ̆m pah kơ Ơi Adai yua kơ tơlơi răm ruă mơ̆ng hơjan pler anŭn, yua kơ tơlơi răm ruă anŭn krip yip biă mă.
And one of the seven angels, which had the seven bowls, came and spoke with me, saying, Come here, I will shew thee the sentence of the great harlot who sits upon the many waters; @  Giơ̆ng anŭn sa čô amăng tơjuh čô ling jang djă tơjuh boh čơlŭ rai hăng laĭ kơ kâo: “Rai bĕ, kâo či kơčrâo brơi ih ƀuh tơlơi phat kơđi đah kơmơi hing ang rih răm, pô hlăk dŏ ber ƀơi ngŏ khul glung ia.

And he carried me away in spirit to a desert; and I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns. @ Yang Bơngăt Hiam gom kâo, laih anŭn ling jang ba kâo nao pơ tơdrŏn tač.

And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and had ornaments of gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication; @ Đah kơmơi anŭn buh ao mriah tăm laih anŭn mriah huč, pơhrôp ñu pô hăng mah, boh pơtâo yom laih anŭn boh pơtâo ačung.

And I saw the woman drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And I wondered, seeing her, with great wonder. @ Kâo ƀuh đah kơmơi anŭn măt hăng drah ƀing rơgoh hiam laih anŭn drah ƀing ngă gơ̆ng jơlan kơ Yêsu. Tơdang kâo ƀuh ñu kâo kơtuă hling hlang biă mă.
And the angel said to me, Why hast thou wondered? *I* will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast which carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns. @ Samơ̆ ling jang laĭ kơ kâo: “Hyư̆m ih dŏ kơtuă hling lĕ?

The beast which thou sawest was, and is not, and is about to come up out of the abyss and go into destruction: and they who dwell on the earth, whose names are not written from the founding of the world in the book of life, shall wonder, seeing the beast, that it was, and is not, and shall be present. @ Hlô ih ƀuh hlâo dih hmâo laih, ră anai ƀu hmâo tah, giăm tơbiă mơ̆ng hlŭng dlam laih anŭn nao kơ tơlơi răm rơngiă.

Here is the mind that has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains, whereon the woman sits. @ Amăng tơlơi anai khŏm hmâo tơlơi rơgơi laih anŭn tơlơi kơhnâo: tơjuh boh akŏ jing tơjuh boh čư̆, anih đah kơmơi anŭn dŏ ber. Gơñu ăt jing tơjuh čô ƀing pơtao mơ̆n: 
And there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he comes he must remain [only] a little while. @ Rơma čô amăng ƀing gơñu tơglưh laih, sa čô ăt dŏ wai lăng, laih anŭn sa čô pơkŏn aka truh ôh. Tơ ñu truh, ñu kơnơ̆ng dŏ ƀiă đôč, ƀu sui ôh. 
And the beast that was and is not, he also is an eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into destruction. @ Bơ kơ hlô hlâo anŭn hmâo laih, samơ̆ ră anai ƀu hmâo dơ̆ng tah, ñu anŭn jing pơtao tal sapăn, ñu ăt jing amăng ƀing tơjuh čô pơtao mơ̆n, laih anŭn hlăk nao pơ tơlơi răm rơngiă. 
And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have not yet received a kingdom, but receive authority as kings one hour with the beast. @ Pluh ƀĕ tơki ih hmâo ƀuh anŭn jing pluh čô pơtao aka ƀu mă tŭ ôh tơlơi dưi wai lăng, samơ̆ gơñu či mă tŭ tơlơi dưi jing pơtao hrŏm hơbĭt hăng hlô anŭn amăng sa mông.

And he says to me, The waters which thou sawest, where the harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues. @ Laih anŭn ling jang laĭ kơ kâo: “Khul glung ia ih ƀuh anŭn, anih đah kơmơi rih răm dŏ ber, jing ƀing ană plei pla, ƀing mơnuih lu, ƀing kơnŭng djuai mơnuih, laih anŭn khul tơlơi pơhiăp phara phara. 
And the ten horns which thou sawest, and the beast, these shall hate the harlot, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and shall burn her with fire; @ Pluh ƀĕ tơki ih hmâo ƀuh laih anŭn hlô či bơrơmŭt kơ đah kơmơi rih răm anŭn.

After these things I saw another angel descending out of the heaven, having great authority: and the earth was lightened with his glory. @ Giơ̆ng kơ tơlơi anŭn kâo ƀuh sa čô ling jang pơkŏn hmâo tơlơi dưi prŏng trŭn mơ̆ng adai, tơlơi guh kơang Ñu bang rơđah abih bang lŏn tơnah. 
And he cried with a strong voice, saying, Great Babylon has fallen, has fallen, and has become the habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hated bird; @ Ñu ur kraih laĭ:

And I heard another voice out of the heaven saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye have not fellowship in her sins, and that ye do not receive of her plagues: @  Giơ̆ng anŭn kâo hmư̆ asăp pơkŏn mơ̆ng adai laĭ:

So much as she has glorified herself and lived luxuriously, so much torment and grief give to her. Because she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and I am not a widow; and I shall in no wise see grief: @  Hơdơ̆ pă Ñu hmâo pơ-ư pơang ñu pô laih anŭn hơdip tui tơlơi amoaih kluh,

And a strong angel took up a stone, as a great millstone, and cast [it] into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall Babylon the great city be cast down, and shall be found no more at all; @  Hlăk anŭn, sa čô ling jang bă hăng tơlơi dưi kơtang mă sa boh pơtâo prŏng hrup hăng sa boh rơsŭng prŏng, glŏm trŭn amăng ia rơsĭ, laih anŭn laĭ: “Ơi Adai či glŏm trŭn plei prŏng Babilôn hrup hăng anŭn mơ̆n, laih anŭn ƀu hmâo hlơi ƀuh ñu dơ̆ng tah.

After these things I heard as a loud voice of a great multitude in the heaven, saying, Hallelujah: the salvation and the glory and the power of our God: @ Giơ̆ng anŭn, kâo hmư̆ amăng adai adih hmâo asăp kraih kar hăng asăp kơ sa phung mơnuih lu laĭ: “Halêluya!

And I heard as a voice of a great crowd, and as a voice of many waters, and as a voice of strong thunders, saying, Hallelujah, for [the] Lord our God the Almighty has taken to himself kingly power. @  Giơ̆ng kơ anŭn kâo hmư̆ hrup hăng asăp phung mơnuih lu biă mă, hrup hăng dơnai lu glung ia, laih anŭn hrup hăng dơnai grơ̆m đah kơtang, ur kraih: “Halêluya!

And I fell before his feet to do him homage. And he says to me, See [thou do it] not. I am thy fellow-bondman, and [the fellow-bondman] of thy brethren who have the testimony of Jesus. Do homage to God. For the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Jesus. @ Kâo bon ƀơi tơkai ñu kiăng kơkuh pơpŭ gơñu, samơ̆ ñu laĭ: “Anăm ngă tui anŭn ôh!

And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head many diadems, having a name written which no one knows but himself; @ Mơta Ñu hrup hăng jơlah apui, ƀơi akŏ Ñu hmâo lu mŭk pơtao; hmâo sa anăn čih ƀơi Ñu, ƀu hmâo hlơi thâo ôh, kơnơ̆ng hơjan Ñu pô đôč thâo.

And out of his mouth goes a sharp [two-edged] sword, that with it he might smite the nations; and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; and he treads the wine-press of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. @ Sa ƀĕ đao ƀơ̆ng biă mă tơbiă mơ̆ng bah Ñu.

And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in mid-heaven, Come, gather yourselves to the great supper of God, @  Giơ̆ng kơ anŭn kâo ƀuh sa čô ling jang dŏ dơ̆ng amăng yang hrơi.

And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat upon the horse, and against his army. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn kâo ƀuh hlô glai laih anŭn ƀing pơtao ƀơi lŏn tơnah hrŏm hơbĭt hăng phung tơhan ƀing gơñu hmâo pơtŭm pơƀŭt glaĭ kiăng pơblah hăng Pô đĭ aseh laih anŭn hăng phung tơhan Ñu. 
And the beast was taken, and the false prophet that [was] with him, who wrought the signs before him by which he deceived them that received the mark of the beast, and those that worship his image. Alive were both cast into the lake of fire which burns with brimstone; @ Samơ̆ arăng mă hĭ hlô glai anŭn, laih anŭn pô laĭ lui hlâo ƀlor hrŏm hơbĭt hăng ñu, pô hmâo ngă laih ƀơi anăp ñu khul gru kơnăl, hăng tơlơi anŭn pô laĭ lui hlâo ƀlor plư ƀing hmâo mă tŭ laih tơlơi čih mrô hlô glai laih anŭn hmâo kơkuh laih kơ rup ñu.

And he laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent who is [the] devil and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, @ Ñu mă ana grai, jing ala đưm adih, jing yang sat, laih anŭn Satan, laih anŭn akă hĭ ñu amăng sa rơbâo thŭn, 
and cast him into the abyss, and shut [it] and sealed [it] over him, that he should not any more deceive the nations until the thousand years were completed; after these things he must be loosed for a little time. @ ling jang glŏm hĭ ñu amăng hlŭng dlam, kơđơ̆l laih anŭn kơđŏm hĭ bah amăng anŭn, kiăng kơ ñu ƀu hyu plư ƀing djuai mơnuih ôh, tơl abih hĭ sa rơbâo thŭn anŭn.

And I saw thrones; and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them; and the souls of those beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God; and those who had not done homage to the beast nor to his image, and had not received the mark on their forehead and hand; and they lived and reigned with the Christ a thousand years: @  Kâo ƀuh lu boh gre pơtao, laih anŭn arăng brơi kơ ƀing dŏ ber ƀơi anŭn tơlơi dưi phat kơđi.

And when the thousand years have been completed, Satan shall be loosed from his prison, @ Giơ̆ng sa rơbâo thŭn abih hĭ, Ơi Adai či phư hĭ Satan mơ̆ng anih krư̆ ñu, 
and shall go out to deceive the nations which [are] in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war, whose number [is] as the sand of the sea. @ laih anŭn ñu či tơbiă nao kiăng plư ƀing djuai mơnuih dŏ djŏp djang lŏn tơnah, jing phung Gôk laih anŭn phung Magôk, kiăng pơƀŭt glaĭ ƀing gơñu kơ tơlơi pơblah.

And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened; and another book was opened, which is [that] of life. And the dead were judged out of the things written in the books according to their works. @ Kâo ƀuh ƀing djai, ƀing prŏng wơ̆t ƀing anĕt, leng kơ dŏ ƀơi anăp gre pơtao; laih anŭn lu sŏp hră hmâo pŏk hĭ.

And he that spoke with me had a golden reed [as] a measure, that he might measure the city, and its gates, and its wall. @ Ling jang pơhiăp hăng kâo djă sa ƀĕ gai pơkă ngă hăng mah, kiăng pơkă plei anŭn, amăng jang, laih anŭn bơnư̆ ñu. 
And the city lies four-square, and its length [is] as much as the breadth. And he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand stadia: the length and the breadth and height of it are equal. @ Plei anŭn pă mơta thar, yong ñu mơđơr hăng da ñu.

And he measured its wall, a hundred [and] forty-four cubits, [a] man's measure, that is, [the] angel's. @ Ling jang ăt pơkă mơ̆n bơnư̆ plei, dơ̆ng ñu hmâo năm pluh met, tui hăng gai pơkă ană mơnuih, laih anŭn ăt jing gai pơkă ling jang mơ̆n. 
And the building of its wall [was] jasper; and the city pure gold, like pure glass: @ Pơnăng bơnư̆ ngă hăng boh pơtâo jaspidi, laih anŭn plei anŭn ngă hăng mah rơgoh, bơngač jơngeh hrup hăng mơnĭl. 
the foundations of the wall of the city [were] adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation, jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; @ Atur bơnư̆ plei ngă pơhrôp hăng djŏp mơta boh pơtâo yom.

And the twelve gates, twelve pearls; each one of the gates, respectively, was of one pearl; and the street of the city pure gold, as transparent glass. @ Pluh dua boh amăng jang ngă hăng pluh dua asar boh pơtâo ačung, rĭm amăng jang ngă hăng kơnơ̆ng sa asar boh pơtâo ačung đôč.

And I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, and the Lamb. @ Kâo ƀu ƀuh ôh sang kơkuh pơpŭ amăng plei anŭn, yua kơ Khua Yang jing Ơi Adai Dưi Kơtang laih anŭn Ană Triu jing sang kơkuh pơpŭ kơ plei anŭn. 
And the city has no need of the sun nor of the moon, that they should shine for it; for the glory of God has enlightened it, and the lamp thereof [is] the Lamb. @ Plei anŭn ƀu kiăng kơ yang hrơi ƀôdah blan pơčrang ñu dơ̆ng ôh, yua kơ tơlơi guh kơang Ơi Adai pơčrang plei anŭn, laih anŭn Ană Triu jing apui kơđen kơ plei anŭn.

And nothing common, nor that maketh an abomination and a lie, shall at all enter into it; but those only who [are] written in the book of life of the Lamb. @ Abih bang ƀing hơƀak drak, ƀing ngă tơlơi bơrơmŭt khĕl, ƀing pleč ƀlor leng kơ ƀu dưi mŭt amăng plei anŭn ôh, samơ̆ kơnơ̆ng ƀing mơnuih hmâo anăn čih laih amăng sŏp hră tơlơi hơdip Ană Triu đôč dưi mŭt.
And he shewed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, going out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. @  Ling jang kơčrâo brơi kâo ƀuh ia krong tơlơi hơdip, bơngač jơngeh hrup hăng mơnĭl, tơbiă ro mơ̆ng gre pơtao Ơi Adai laih anŭn Ană Triu, 
In the midst of its street, and of the river, on this side and on that side, [the] tree of life, producing twelve fruits, in each month yielding its fruit; and the leaves of the tree for healing of the nations. @ ro tơ̆ng krah jơlan plei anŭn; Ƀơi dua gah hang ia krong anŭn hmâo phŭn kơyâo tơlơi hơdip, ñu mơboh pluh dua wơ̆t amăng sa thŭn, rĭm blan ñu mơboh sa wơ̆t, laih anŭn hla ñu arăng yua kiăng pơsuaih ƀing djuai mơnuih.

And night shall not be any more, and no need of a lamp, and light of [the] sun; for [the] Lord God shall shine upon them, and they shall reign to the ages of ages. @ Mlam ƀu či hmâo dơ̆ng ôh, ƀing gơñu ƀu kiăng kơ tơlơi bơngač kơ apui kơđen ƀôdah yang hrơi dơ̆ng ôh, yua kơ Khua Yang jing Ơi Adai či pơčrang bơngač kơ ƀing gơñu.

And he said to me, These words [are] faithful and true; and [the] Lord God of the spirits of the prophets has sent his angel to shew to his bondmen the things which must soon come to pass. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ling jang laĭ kơ kâo: “Boh pơhiăp anŭn năng lăp đaŏ kơnang laih anŭn tơpă sĭt.

And I, John, [was] he who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to do homage before the feet of the angel who shewed me these things. @ Kâo jing Yôhan, pô hmâo hmư̆ laih, laih anŭn hmâo ƀuh laih tơlơi anŭn.

And he says to me, See [thou do it] not. I am thy fellow-bondman, and [the fellow-bondman] of thy brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Do homage to God. @ Samơ̆ ñu laĭ kơ kâo: “Anăm ngă tui anŭn ôh!

And he says to me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book. The time is near. @ Giơ̆ng anŭn ñu laĭ kơ kâo: “Anăm kơđŏm hĭ ôh khul boh pơhiăp laĭ lui hlâo amăng sŏp hră anai, yua kơ mông giăm truh yơh. 
Let him that does unrighteously do unrighteously still; and let the filthy make himself filthy still; and let him that is righteous practise righteousness still; and he that is holy, let him be sanctified still. @ Hlơi pô ƀu tơpă ăt ngă nanao tơlơi ƀu tơpă; hlơi pô hơƀak drak ăt ngă tơlơi hơƀak drak nanao; hlơi pô jing tơpă ăt ngă tơlơi tơpă nanao; hlơi pô hơdip rơgoh hiam ăt hơdip rơgoh hiam nanao.”
Behold, I come quickly, and my reward with me, to render to every one as his work shall be. @  “Anai nê, Kâo rai tañ, djă ba gơnam apah bơni hrŏm hơbĭt hăng Kâo, kiăng apah bơni kơ rĭm čô tui hăng bruă gơñu hmâo ngă laih.

And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is athirst come; he that will, let him take [the] water of life freely. @  Yang Bơngăt Hiam laih anŭn Dra Pơkô̆ hrŏm hơbĭt laĭ: “Rai bĕ!” Laih anŭn brơi abih bang hlơi pô hmư̆ laĭ: “Rai bĕ!” Hlơi pô mơhao, brơi ñu rai bĕ!
