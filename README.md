# Jrai Digitization Project

As a resident of Pleiku City with a passion for Jrai culture and language, I've acquired a collection of books related to the language. My goal is to digitize these materials for broader accessibility. Leveraging my programming skills, I'm automating aspects of the project to streamline the process.

I plan to use LibreOffice Base for ease of data entry and manipulation then produce different formats from that.

## Areas of the Project

* jrai keyboard like uni-key (WIP)
* scanned books (WIP)
* word lists (WIP)
* glosbe data (WIP)
* Jrai bible to XML (WIP)
